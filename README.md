# Welcome to My Workspace!

Hi! I’m not sure how you ended up in this humble space, but you are sincerely welcome :) This is my "Writing a Python and AI Book" workspace.

I've lived as a "컴맹" (meaning someone who doesn't know much about computers) for 30 years, so I’m currently struggling to understand Python and AI.    

However, I believe that someday I will be able to write a book based on a full understanding of Python and AI. But for now, I’m still studying, so the contents here are not entirely from my own understanding. Most of them are copied from sources like Coursera.org, O'Reilly books, Deeplearning.ai, etc. Only some of the content includes my own opinions. However, before adding anything here, I try to understand it fully and only write down what I do understand. In other words, I am collecting knowledge from many sources.    

After completing my studies, I hope to write a book that is truly my own. So, please don’t misunderstand and think that this content represents my complete understanding at this point.

I’ve drawn a lot of inspiration for this project from "대두족장님". If you want to check out his excellent work, click here: [Deep-Dive-Into-AI-With-MLX-PyTorch](https://github.com/neobundy/Deep-Dive-Into-AI-With-MLX-PyTorch/)

Have a great day! :)

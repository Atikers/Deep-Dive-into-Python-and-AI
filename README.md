# Welcome to My Workspace!

Hi! I don't know how you ended up in this humble place, but you are sincerely welcome :) This is my "Writing Python and AI book" workspace.

I have lived as a "컴맹" (meaning someone who doesn't know about computers) for 30 years, so I am struggling to understand Python and AI. However, I believe that someday I will be able to write a book with my full understanding. But for now, the contents in my workspace are not from my full understanding. Most of them are copied from sources like ***Coursera.org, O'Reilly books, Deeplearning.ai***, etc. Only some are my own opinions. I am collecting knowledge from many sources. After completing this collection, I might be able to write a book that is truly my own. So, please don't misunderstand that these contents are from my full understanding.

I have drawn a lot of inspiration for this project from "대두족장님" If you want to visit his excellent work, click this : [대두족장님 AI book](https://github.com/neobundy/Deep-Dive-Into-AI-With-MLX-PyTorch/tree/master/book/000-hello-ai-world)

Have a good day! :)

# Supervised Learning - Regression, Classification

## ***What is Supervised Learning?***

Machine learning is a technology that helps computers learn from data to make decisions. One of the most common types of machine learning is called **supervised learning**. In supervised learning, a computer learns by looking at examples where both the **input** (the data you give it) and the **output** (the correct answer) are provided. By studying these examples, the computer can learn how to make predictions on its own when given new inputs.

### ***Example: Spam Email Filter***

Let’s say you want your email system to figure out which emails are **spam** (junk) and which are not. The input would be the content of the email, and the output would be a label saying "spam" or "not spam." You can teach a computer to do this by showing it lots of emails that are labeled correctly. Once the computer has seen enough examples, it can start guessing whether a new email is spam or not, just from its content.

### ***More Examples***

Here are other things supervised learning can do:
- **Speech Recognition:** It can listen to someone speaking and turn it into text.
- **Machine Translation:** It can take a sentence in English and translate it into another language, like Spanish or Korean.
- **Online Ads:** It can predict whether you will click on an ad based on what you like, helping websites show you ads that match your interests.
- **Self-driving Cars:** It can use data from cameras and sensors to figure out where other cars are on the road, helping the car drive safely.
- **Manufacturing:** It can look at pictures of products like smartphones and decide if they have any defects, like scratches.

In all these cases, the computer is first trained by giving it many examples where both the input and the correct output are provided. After the training, the computer can start making predictions when given new inputs.

## ***How Supervised Learning Works***

Supervised learning can be explained in a simple way. Think of it like a recipe where different parts work together to solve a problem. Here are the main parts:

### ***Key Parts of Supervised Learning***

1. **Model:**  
   This is the "brain" of the system. The model learns how to match inputs (like an email) to outputs (like "spam" or "not spam"). It gets better the more examples it sees.

2. **Data:**  
   The **data** are the examples used to train the model. For example, in spam filtering, the data would be lots of emails, some marked as spam and some marked as not spam.

3. **Loss Function:**  
   This is how the computer checks how close its predictions are to the right answers. If it makes a mistake, the loss function shows how wrong it is, so it can try to improve.

4. **Optimizer:**  
   The optimizer helps the model get better by adjusting how it makes decisions. It uses the feedback from the loss function to make the model smarter.

5. **Prediction:**  
   After the model is trained, it can look at new inputs and make a **prediction**. For example, it might predict if a new email is spam or not.

## ***Two Types of Supervised Learning***

There are two main types of supervised learning: **regression** and **classification**.

### ***Regression***

In **regression**, the goal is to predict a number. For example, imagine you want to predict the **price of a house** based on its size. The input would be the size of the house, and the output would be the predicted price. The model learns by looking at examples of house sizes and their prices.

### ***Classification***

In **classification**, the goal is to predict a **category** or group. For example, you might want to classify an email as "spam" or "not spam." The input is the email, and the output is the category (spam or not spam). The model learns from examples and improves over time.

## ***Example: Predicting House Prices***

Let’s go deeper into predicting house prices. 

Imagine you have data about houses, like their size and their price. You can use this data to teach a model how to predict house prices. The **input** would be the size of the house, and the **output** would be the price. After learning from many examples, the model can start making predictions. For example, if the house is 750 square feet, the model might guess that the price is $150,000.

## ***What is Classification?***

In supervised learning, there are two main types of problems: **regression** and **classification**. In this section, we’ll focus on **classification**. But first, let’s break it down in a way that’s easy to understand.

Imagine you’re a doctor, and you’re building a tool to help detect **breast cancer**. Early detection can save lives, so this tool is very important. The tool you’re building uses **machine learning** to decide if a lump, or tumor, in a patient is either **benign** (not dangerous) or **malignant** (cancerous).

Your tool looks at medical records, like the **size** of the tumor, and tries to guess whether it's dangerous or not. In this case:
- **Input (x):** The size of the tumor.
- **Output (y):** Whether the tumor is benign (we'll call it 0) or malignant (we’ll call it 1).

### ***What Makes Classification Different?***

In **regression**, like predicting house prices, the computer tries to guess any number (like $150,000, $200,000, etc.). But in **classification**, the computer only has a few **categories** or **classes** to choose from. 

For example, in the breast cancer problem, there are only two possible answers: **benign (0)** or **malignant (1)**. It’s like asking the computer a yes-or-no question.

Here’s another example: If you’re building a system to recognize animals in pictures, the input could be a picture of an animal, and the output would be the category like **cat** or **dog**. In classification, we always predict a **category** (like cat or dog) instead of a number.

## ***Visualizing Classification***

Let’s go back to our breast cancer example. Imagine you have a graph where:
- The **horizontal axis** represents the size of the tumor.
- The **vertical axis** represents whether the tumor is benign (0) or malignant (1).

If you have many patients with tumors of different sizes, you can plot their data on this graph. For benign tumors, we’ll use circles (O), and for malignant tumors, we’ll use crosses (X). 

### ***Predicting for a New Patient***

Now, a new patient walks in. Their tumor size is somewhere between the ones we’ve seen before. The question is: Will your machine learning system say the tumor is benign or malignant? The system has learned from the examples it’s seen before, and it will classify this new tumor as either benign (0) or malignant (1).

## ***More Than Two Categories***

Classification isn’t just limited to two categories. Let’s say in our breast cancer example, if the tumor is malignant, there could be **different types of cancer**. So, the system could predict:
- **Type 1 cancer (1)** 
- **Type 2 cancer (2)**

In this case, the system would have **three categories**: benign (0), type 1 cancer (1), and type 2 cancer (2). This is still classification because it’s predicting from a small number of categories (0, 1, or 2).

## ***Multiple Inputs***

In our breast cancer example, we’ve only used one input so far: the size of the tumor. But in real life, doctors look at more than one thing to make a diagnosis. For example, they might also check the patient’s **age**. 

Now, let’s imagine a graph where:
- **One axis** represents the tumor size.
- **Another axis** represents the patient’s age.

Each patient’s data is plotted on this graph, with circles (O) for benign tumors and crosses (X) for malignant ones. If a new patient comes in, the machine learning system will use both **tumor size** and **age** to predict whether their tumor is benign or malignant. The system will draw a line that separates benign tumors from malignant ones, helping the doctor make a diagnosis.

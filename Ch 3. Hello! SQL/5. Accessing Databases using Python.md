# Accessing Databases Using Python

## 1. How to Access Databases Using Python

Python is a popular programming language that is widely used for data analysis and data science. It is also used for web development, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. And Python has a rich ecosystem of libraries and tools that make it easy to work with databases.
Python ecosystem : 
* **NumPy** and **Pandas** for data manipulation and analysis
* **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization
* **Scikit-learn** and **TensorFlow** for machine learning
* **Django** and **Flask** for web development
* **Jupyter** for interactive data analysis and visualization
> **What is the difference between Python and SQL?**    
> **SQL** is a language that is used to interact with relational databases. It is used to create, read, update, and delete data in a database.  
> **Python** is a general-purpose programming language that can be used for a wide range of tasks, including working with databases.
> Shortly, Python is a programming language, and SQL is a query language.

Notebooks allows you to write and execute code in an interactive environment. This makes it easy to explore data, visualize results, and share your findings with others.
Popular notebooks are Jupyter and Google Colab.
> **What is Jupyter Notebook?**    
> Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.

The Python code connects to the database using API calls.
> **What is a SQL API(Applicaition Programming Interface)?**    
> To pass SQL statements to the DBMS, an application program calls functions in the API, and it calls other functions to retrieve query results and sattus information from the DBMS

APIs used by popular SQL-based DBMS systems
* **MySQL** - MySQL C API
* **PostgreSQL** - Psycopg2
* **IBM DB2** - ibm_db
* **Oracle** - OCI
* **SQL Server** - dblib API
* **Java** - JDBC

## 2. Writing code using DB-API

### 1) What is DB-API?
Let's think about **User**, **Jupyter Notebook**, **DBMS**.  
User -> Jupyter Notebook -> (DB API calls) -> DBMS
DB-API is a Python Database API Specification. It provides a standard interface for connecting to relational databases from Python.
Allows a single program that to work with multiple kinds of realtional databases.
Examples of libraries
* **DB2 Warehouse on Cloud** - Ibm_db
* **Compose for MySQL** - MySQL Connector/Python
* **Compose for PostgreSQL** - Psycopg2
* **Compose for MongoDB** - PyMongo

### 2) Concepts of the Python DB-API
**Connection Objects**
* Database Connections
* Manage transactions
* Examples :
    * Cursor(), Commit(), Close(), etc.
**Query Objects**
* Database Queries
* Scroll through result set
* Retrieve results
* Examples :
    * callproc(), execute(), fetchone(), fetchall(), etc.

### 3) What is a database cursor?
Let's think about **Your Application** and **Cursor**, **Database**
* Your Application -> Cursor -> Database
* A cursor is a database object that allows you to retrieve data from a result set one row at a time.
* Cursors are used to process individual rows returned by database system queries.
* Cursors are created by the connection object associated with the database.
* Cursors are used to execute SQL queries and retrieve the results.

### 4) Writing code using DB-API

```python
from dbmodule import connect # Import the connect function from the dbmodule library
Connection = connect('databasename', 'username', 'pswd') # Create a connection object
Cursor = Connection.cursor() # Create a cursor object
Cursor.execute('SELECT * FROM table') # Run Queries
Results = Cursor.fetchall()  # Fetch results
Cursor.close()               # Free resources
Connection.close()           # Close connection
```
## 3. Accessing Databases using SQL Magic

### 1) Magic Statements in Jupyter Notebook
Magic commands are special commands that provide special functionality in Jupyter Notebook. They are not valid Python code, but they are used to interact with the Jupyter Notebook environment. They are designed to solve standard data analysis problems and make it easier to work with data in Jupyter Notebook. It's like a keyboard shortcut for common tasks. 

### 2) Types of Cell Magics
* **Line Magics** - Start with a single % character and apply to a single line of code.
    * Examples
        * %time - Measure the time taken to execute a single line of code.
        * %load - Load code from an external file into a cell.
        * %run - Run a Python script in a cell.
        * %who - List all variables in the current scope.   
* **Cell Magics** - Start with a double %% character and apply to the entire cell.
> **What is the difference between Line and Cell Magics?**    
> Line magics apply to a single line of code, while cell magics apply to the entire cell. So easy!

### 3) Using Line Magic Statements
```python
%pwd
%ls # Both Line magics in the same cell
```
```python
%timeit <statement> # Line Magic : Time for executing single statement
```
```python
%%timeit
<statement_1>
<statement_2>
<statement_3>   # Cell Magic : Time for executing whole cell
```
```python
%%writefile myfile.txt
<statement_1>
<statement_2>
<statement_3>   # Cell Magic : Write all statements of the cell to myfile.txt
```

### 4) Using Cell Magic Statements
```python
%%HTML
<h> Hello world </h1>   # Cell Magic : Write HTML code in cells and render it
```
```python
%%javascript    
alert('Hello world')   # Cell Magic : Write JavaScript code in cells and render it
```
```python
%%bash
echo "Hello world"     # Cell Magic : Write Bash code in cells and render it
```
>**What is bash?**    
>Bash is a Unix shell and command language that is used to interact with the operating system. It is the default shell for most Unix-based operating systems, including Linux and macOS.

### 5) Preparation for using SQL Magic statements
Before using SQL Magic, you need to install the ipython-sql library.
```python
!pip install --user ipython-sql
```
And, you need to load the SQL extension using the following command.
```python
%load_ext sql
```

Examples: Using SQL with SQLite Database
```python
import sqlite3  # Import the sqlite3 library
conn=sqlite3.connect('HR.db')   # Create a connection object
```
```python
%load_ext sql   # Load the SQL extension
```
```python
%sql sqlite:///HR.db   # Connect to the SQLite database
```
```python
%sql SELECT * FROM employees   # Run a SQL query
```

## 4. Analyzing Data with Python
Let's play with McDonald's Menu nutritional data sets.

### Load CSV to SQLite 3 with Pandas
```python
import pandas as pd
import sqlite3
data=pd.read_csv('./menu.csv')
conn=sqlite3.connect('McDonalds.db')
data.to_sql('MCDONALDS_NUTRITION', conn)
```

### Using Pandas to query the database
```python
df=pd.read_sql("SELECT * FROM MCDONALDS_NUTRITION", conn)
prind(df)
```

### Learn about the data
```python
df.describe(include='all')
```
Then, I get the following:  
![image-0](https://github.com/Atikers/Images/blob/main/Ch%203.%20SQL/image-2.png)

#### Which food item has maximum sodium content?
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline  # Magic command to display plots inline
import seaborn as sns   # Import the seaborn library : A Python visualization library based on matplotlib
```
```python
plot=sns.swarmplot(x='Category', y='Sodium', data=df)   # Create a swarm plot : A categorical scatterplot with non-overlapping points
plt.setp(plot.get_xticklabels(), rotation=70)   # Rotate the x-axis labels : Set the rotation angle of the x-axis labels
plt.tilte('Sodium Content')  # Set the title of the plot
plt.show()   # Display the plot
```
Then, I get the following:  
![image-1](https://github.com/Atikers/Images/blob/main/Ch%203.%20SQL/image-1.png)

```python
df['Sodium'].describe()   # Get the summary statistics for the 'Sodium' column
```
Then, I get the following:  
![image-3](https://github.com/Atikers/Images/blob/main/Ch%203.%20SQL/image-3.png)

```python
df['Sodium'].idxmax()   # Get the index of the maximum value in the 'Sodium' column
```
Then, I get the following:  
![image-4](https://github.com/Atikers/Images/blob/main/Ch%203.%20SQL/image-4.png)

```python
df.at[82, 'Item']   # Get the value of the 'Item' column at index 82
```
Then, I get the following:  
![image-5](https://github.com/Atikers/Images/blob/main/Ch%203.%20SQL/image-5.png)

So, We found that the food item with the maximum sodium content is ***Chicken McNuggets (40 piece)***! :) if you enjoy the chicken nuggets, you should be careful about the sodium content :(

#### Further data exploration using visualization
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline
import seaborn as sns
```
```python
plot=sns.swarmplot(x='Protein', y='Total Fat', data=df)
plot.show()
```
Then, I get the following:  
![image-6](https://github.com/Atikers/Images/blob/main/Ch%203.%20SQL/image-6.png)

We found that the correlation between Protein and Total Fat is very strong! if you eat high protein food for muscle, you should be careful about the total fat content! :(

> **What is Pearsnor?**    
> Pearson correlation coefficient is a measure of the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. It ranges from -1 to 1, 
> So, if Pearsonr is 0.81, it means that the correlation between two variables is very strong.

```python
import matlibplot.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline
import seaborn as sns
```
```python
plot=sns.set_style('whitegrid') # Set the style of the plot : Set the aesthetic style of the plots
ax=sns.boxplot(x=df["Sugars"])  # Create a box plot of the 'Sugars' column : A box plot is a standardized way of displaying the distribution of data based on a five-number summary
plot.show()
```

Visulizing data is very important to understand the data and make better decisions. I will explain more about data visualization in the next time.

# Accessing Databases Using Python

## 1. How to Access Databases Using Python

Python is a popular programming language widely used for data analysis, data science, web development, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. It has a rich ecosystem of libraries and tools that make it easy to work with databases.

**Python ecosystem**:
- **NumPy** and **Pandas** for data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** and **TensorFlow** for machine learning
- **Django** and **Flask** for web development
- **Jupyter** for interactive data analysis and visualization

> **What is the difference between Python and SQL?**  
> **SQL** is a language used to interact with relational databases, enabling the creation, reading, updating, and deletion of data.  
> **Python** is a general-purpose programming language that can be used for a wide range of tasks, including database management.  
> In short, Python is a programming language, while SQL is a query language.

### Using Notebooks for Interactive Data Analysis

Notebooks like Jupyter and Google Colab allow you to write and execute code in an interactive environment. This makes it easy to explore data, visualize results, and share your findings.

> **What is Jupyter Notebook?**  
> Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that lets you create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.

### Connecting Python to Databases

Python connects to databases using API calls.

> **What is a SQL API (Application Programming Interface)?**  
> A SQL API allows an application to pass SQL statements to the DBMS, retrieve query results, and gather status information from the DBMS.

### APIs for Popular SQL-based DBMS Systems:
- **MySQL** - MySQL Connector/Python
- **PostgreSQL** - Psycopg2
- **IBM DB2** - ibm_db
- **Oracle** - cx_Oracle
- **SQL Server** - pyodbc
- **Java** - JDBC

## 2. Writing Code Using DB-API

### 1) What is DB-API?

DB-API is a Python Database API Specification. It provides a standard interface for connecting to relational databases from Python, allowing a single program to work with multiple types of relational databases.

**Examples of libraries**:
- **DB2** - ibm_db
- **MySQL** - MySQL Connector/Python
- **PostgreSQL** - Psycopg2
- **MongoDB** - PyMongo

### 2) Concepts of the Python DB-API

**Connection Objects**:
- Handle database connections and manage transactions.
- Examples: `Cursor()`, `Commit()`, `Close()`.

**Query Objects**:
- Handle database queries, scroll through result sets, and retrieve results.
- Examples: `callproc()`, `execute()`, `fetchone()`, `fetchall()`.

### 3) What is a Database Cursor?

A cursor is a database object that allows you to retrieve data from a result set one row at a time. Cursors are created by the connection object associated with the database and are used to execute SQL queries and retrieve the results.

**Workflow**:
- **Your Application** -> **Cursor** -> **Database**

### 4) Writing Code Using DB-API

Here’s how you can connect to a database, run a query, and retrieve results using Python’s DB-API:

```python
from dbmodule import connect  # Import the connect function from the dbmodule library

Connection = connect('databasename', 'username', 'pswd')  # Create a connection object
Cursor = Connection.cursor()  # Create a cursor object
Cursor.execute('SELECT * FROM table')  # Run a query
Results = Cursor.fetchall()  # Fetch all results
Cursor.close()  # Close the cursor to free resources
Connection.close()  # Close the connection
```

## 3. Accessing Databases Using SQL Magic

### 1) Magic Commands in Jupyter Notebook

Magic commands are special commands in Jupyter Notebook that are not valid Python code but provide enhanced functionality. They solve standard data analysis problems and simplify working with data.

### 2) Types of Magic Commands

- **Line Magics** - Start with a single `%` character and apply to a single line of code.
    - Examples:
        - `%time` - Measure the time taken to execute a single line of code.
        - `%load` - Load code from an external file into a cell.
        - `%run` - Run a Python script in a cell.
        - `%who` - List all variables in the current scope.

- **Cell Magics** - Start with a double `%%` character and apply to the entire cell.
    - Examples:
        - `%%time` - Measure the time taken to execute the entire cell.
        - `%%writefile` - Write the contents of a cell to a file.
        - `%%HTML` - Render the cell as HTML.
        - `%%javascript` - Render the cell as JavaScript.
        - `%%bash` - Run Bash commands in the cell.

> **What is the difference between Line and Cell Magics?**  
> Line magics apply to a single line of code, while cell magics apply to the entire cell.

### 3) Using Line Magic Statements

```python
%pwd  # Print the current working directory
%ls   # List files in the current directory
```
```python
%timeit <statement>  # Measure the execution time of a single statement
```
```python
%%timeit
<statement_1>
<statement_2>
<statement_3>  # Measure the execution time of all statements in the cell
```
```python
%%writefile myfile.txt
<statement_1>
<statement_2>
<statement_3>  # Write the contents of the cell to myfile.txt
```

### 4) Using Cell Magic Statements
```python
%%HTML
<h1>Hello world</h1>  # Render HTML content in the cell
```
```python
%%javascript
alert('Hello world')  # Execute JavaScript code in the cell
```
```python
%%bash
echo "Hello world"  # Execute Bash commands in the cell
```
>**What is bash?**    
>Bash is a Unix shell and command language used to interact with the operating system. It is the default shell for most Unix-based operating systems, including Linux and macOS.

### 5) Preparation for using SQL Magic statements
Before using SQL Magic, you need to install the `ipython-sql` library.
```python
!pip install --user ipython-sql
```
Next, load the SQL extension in Notebook.
```python
%load_ext sql
```

Examples: Using SQL with SQLite Database
```python
import sqlite3  # Import the sqlite3 library
conn=sqlite3.connect('HR.db')   # Create a connection object
```
```python
%load_ext sql   # Load the SQL extension
```
```python
%sql sqlite:///HR.db   # Connect to the SQLite database
```
```python
%sql SELECT * FROM employees   # Run a SQL query
```

## 4. Analyzing Data with Python

Let's explore McDonald's menu nutritional data to perform some data analysis and visualization.

```python
import pandas as pd
import sqlite3
```
### Load the CSV data into a Pandas DataFrame
```python
data = pd.read_csv('./menu.csv')
```

### Create a connection to the SQLite database
```python
conn = sqlite3.connect('McDonalds.db')
```

### Save the DataFrame to the database
```python
data.to_sql('MCDONALDS_NUTRITION', conn, if_exists='replace', index=False)
```

### Run a SQL query and load the results into a DataFrame
```python
df = pd.read_sql("SELECT * FROM MCDONALDS_NUTRITION", conn)
print(df)
```

### Learn about the data

#### Get summary statistics for the DataFrame
```python
summary_stats = df.describe(include='all')
print(summary_stats)
```

Then, I get the following:  
![image-0](https://github.com/Atikers/Images/blob/main/Ch%203.%20SQL/image-2.png)

#### Which food item has maximum sodium content?
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline  # Magic command to display plots inline
import seaborn as sns   # Import the seaborn library : A Python visualization library based on matplotlib
```
```python
plot=sns.swarmplot(x='Category', y='Sodium', data=df)   # Create a swarm plot : A categorical scatterplot with non-overlapping points
plt.setp(plot.get_xticklabels(), rotation=70)   # Rotate the x-axis labels : Set the rotation angle of the x-axis labels
plt.tilte('Sodium Content')  # Set the title of the plot
plt.show()   # Display the plot
```
Then, I get the following:  
![image-1](https://github.com/Atikers/Images/blob/main/Ch%203.%20SQL/image-1.png)

```python
df['Sodium'].describe()   # Get the summary statistics for the 'Sodium' column
```
Then, I get the following:  
![image-3](https://github.com/Atikers/Images/blob/main/Ch%203.%20SQL/image-3.png)

```python
df['Sodium'].idxmax()   # Get the index of the maximum value in the 'Sodium' column
```
Then, I get the following:  
![image-4](https://github.com/Atikers/Images/blob/main/Ch%203.%20SQL/image-4.png)

```python
df.at[82, 'Item']   # Get the value of the 'Item' column at index 82
```
Then, I get the following:  
![image-5](https://github.com/Atikers/Images/blob/main/Ch%203.%20SQL/image-5.png)

So, We found that the food item with the maximum sodium content is ***Chicken McNuggets (40 piece)***! :) if you enjoy the chicken nuggets, you should be careful about the sodium content :(

#### Further data exploration using visualization
```python
plot=sns.swarmplot(x='Protein', y='Total Fat', data=df)
plot.show()
```
Then, I get the following:  
![image-6](https://github.com/Atikers/Images/blob/main/Ch%203.%20SQL/image-6.png)

We found that the correlation between Protein and Total Fat is very strong! if you eat high protein food for muscle, you should be careful about the total fat content! :(

> **What is Pearsnor?**    
> Pearson correlation coefficient is a measure of the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. It ranges from -1 to 1, 
> So, if Pearsonr is 0.81, it means that the correlation between two variables is very strong.

Visulizing data is very important to understand the data and make better decisions. I will explain more about data visualization in the next time.

# Intermediate SQL

## 1. Refining Results

### 1) Using String Patterns, Ranges, and Sets of Values

#### Retrieving Rows from a Table
* The SQL `SELECT` statement is used to retrieve rows from a table.

* **Syntax**:
    ```sql
    SELECT column_name FROM table_name;
    ```

* **Example**:
    ```sql
    SELECT book_id, title FROM book;
    ```
    You can also use the `WHERE` clause to filter the rows based on specific conditions.

#### Retrieving Rows Using a String Pattern
* If you don't remember the exact value of a column, you can use a string pattern to retrieve rows.
* For example, if you remember that the title of the book starts with "The", you can use "The%" to retrieve rows.

* **Example**:
    ```sql
    SELECT book_id, title FROM book WHERE title LIKE 'The%';
    ```

#### Retrieving Rows Using a Range
* You can use a range to retrieve rows using operators like `>` (greater than), `<` (less than), `>=` (greater than or equal to), and `<=` (less than or equal to).
* You can also use the `BETWEEN` operator to retrieve rows within a specific range.

* **Example**:
    ```sql
    SELECT book_id, title FROM book WHERE pages >= 300 AND pages <= 400;
    ```
    ```sql
    SELECT book_id, title FROM book WHERE pages BETWEEN 300 AND 400;
    ```

#### Retrieving Rows Using Sets of Values
* You can use a set of values to retrieve rows.
* By using the `OR` operator, you can retrieve rows that match any of the values in the set.

* **Example**:
    ```sql
    SELECT firstname, lastname, country FROM Author WHERE country = 'USA' OR country = 'UK';
    ```

* Alternatively, you can use the `IN` operator to achieve the same result.

* **Example**:
    ```sql
    SELECT firstname, lastname, country FROM Author WHERE country IN ('USA', 'UK');
    ```

### 2) Sorting Result Sets
* By default, the `SELECT` statement retrieves rows in the order they were inserted into the table.
* For example, running the following query will retrieve the rows in their insertion order.

* **Example**:
    ```sql
    SELECT book_id, title FROM book;
    ```

* You can sort the result set using the `ORDER BY` clause.

* **Syntax**:
    ```sql
    SELECT column_name FROM table_name ORDER BY column_name ASC|DESC;
    ```

* **Example**:
    ```sql
    SELECT book_id, title FROM book ORDER BY title ASC;
    ```

> `ASC`: Ascending order  
> `DESC`: Descending order

### 3) Grouping Result Sets

#### Eliminating Duplicates Using the `DISTINCT` and `GROUP BY` Clauses
* The `DISTINCT` clause can be used to eliminate duplicates from the result set.
* For example, the query `SELECT country FROM Author` might return duplicates like `USA, USA, UK, USA, UK, UK...`.
* However, using the `DISTINCT` clause will remove duplicates.

* **Syntax**:
    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT column_name FROM table_name;
    ```

* **Example**:
    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT country FROM Author;
    ```

* You can also use the `GROUP BY` clause to group rows with the same values in a column.

* **Example**:
    ```sql
    SELECT country, COUNT(*) FROM Author GROUP BY country; # This query groups rows that have the same values in the country column and counts the number of rows in each group.
    ```

#### Restricting the Result Set Using the `HAVING` Clause
* The `HAVING` clause is used to restrict the result set after grouping.
* For example, if you want to retrieve groups with more than one row, you can use the `HAVING` clause.

* **Syntax**:
    ```sql
    SELECT column_name, COUNT(*) FROM table_name GROUP BY column_name HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
    ```

* **Example**:
    ```sql
    SELECT country, COUNT(*) FROM Author GROUP BY country HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
    ```

## 2. Functions, Sub-queries, Multiple Tables

### 1) Built-in Database Functions

#### Built-in Database Functions
* Built-in functions can be included as part of SQL statements, helping to reduce the amount of data retrieved from the database.
* Let's consider the `Book` table:
    * **BOOK_ID** (INTEGER), **TITLE** (VARCHAR(20)), **PAGES** (INTEGER), **COST** (DECIMAL(5,2)), **PUBLISH_DATE** (DATE)

* **Example**: This query retrieves the number of rows in the `Book` table:
    ```sql
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Book;
    ```

* **Aggregate or Column Functions**:

    ```sql
    SUM(column_name) : Add up all the values in a column
        Syntax : SELECT SUM(column_name) FROM table_name;
        Example : SELECT SUM(pages) FROM Book;
        You can also explicitly name the column in the result set. e.g. SELECT SUM(pages) AS TotalPages FROM Book;
    AVG(column_name) : Calculate the average of the values in a column
        Syntax : SELECT AVG(column_name) FROM table_name;
        Example : SELECT AVG(pages) FROM Book;
    ```

    You can also perform mathematical operations between columns.

    ```sql
    Example : SELECT AVG(cost/pages) FROM Book;
    ```

    ```sql
    MIN(column_name), MAX(column_name) : Return the minimum or maximum value in a column
        Syntax : SELECT MIN(column_name) FROM table_name;
        Example : SELECT MIN(cost) FROM Book;
    ```

    You can also use the `WHERE` clause to restrict the rows.

    ```sql
    Example : SELECT MIN(cost) FROM Book WHERE pages > 300;
    ```

* **Scalar and String Functions**:

    Scalar functions perform operations on every input value. Examples include `ROUND`, `LENGTH`, `UCASE`, `LCASE`, etc.

    ```sql
    ROUND(column_name) : Round the values in a column
        Syntax : SELECT ROUND(column_name) FROM table_name;
        Example : SELECT ROUND(cost) FROM Book;
    LENGTH(column_name) : Return the length of the values in a column
        Syntax : SELECT LENGTH(column_name) FROM table_name;
        Example : SELECT LENGTH(title) FROM Book;
    ```

    `UCASE(column_name)`, `LCASE(column_name)` : Convert the values in a column to uppercase or lowercase

    ```sql
    Syntax : SELECT UCASE(column_name) FROM table_name;
    Example : SELECT UCASE(title) FROM Book;
    ```

    You can also use the `WHERE` clause to restrict the rows.

    ```sql
    Example : SELECT UCASE(title) FROM Book WHERE pages > 300;
    ```

    And you can also use the `DISTINCT` clause to eliminate duplicates.

    ```sql
    Example : SELECT DISTINCT UCASE(title) FROM Book;
    ```

* **Date and Time Functions**:
    * Most databases contain special data types for storing dates and times.
    * **DATE** - `YYYYMMDD` (8 digits), **TIME** - `HHMMSS` (6 digits), **TIMESTAMP** - `YYYYMMDDHHMMSSZZZZZZ` (20 digits, `ZZZZZZ`: milliseconds)

    * **Date/Time Functions**:
        * **`DAY`, `MONTH`, `YEAR`**: Extract the day, month, or year from a date.
            ```sql
            Syntax : SELECT DAY(column_name) FROM table_name;
            Example : SELECT DAY(publish_date) FROM Book;
            Example : SELECT DAY(publish_date) FROM Book WHERE pages > 300;
            ```

        * **`DATE_ADD`, `DATE_SUB`**: Add or subtract a value from a date.
            ```sql
            Syntax : SELECT DATE_ADD(column_name, INTERVAL value unit) FROM table_name;
            Example : SELECT DATE_ADD(publish_date, INTERVAL 1 DAY) FROM Book;
            ```

        * **`DATE_DIFF`**: Calculate the difference between two dates.
            ```sql
            Syntax : SELECT DATE_DIFF(CURRENT_DATE, column_name) FROM table_name;
            Example : SELECT DATE_DIFF(CURRENT_DATE, publish_date) FROM Book;
            ```

        > **`CURRENT_DATE`** is a built-in function that returns the current date.

        * **`FROM_DAYS`**: Converts a numeric value representing a number of days to a `YYYYMMDD` date format.
            ```sql
            Example : SELECT FROM_DAYS(DATE_DIFF(CURRENT_DATE, publish_date)) FROM Book;
            ```

### 2) Sub-queries: Overcoming Limitations of Aggregate Functions

A sub-query is a query within another query. Because we cannot directly evaluate aggregate functions in the `WHERE` clause, we use sub-queries to evaluate them.

* **Example**:
    ```sql
    SELECT title FROM Book WHERE pages = MAX(pages); (This query will not work)
    SELECT title FROM Book WHERE pages = (SELECT MAX(pages) FROM Book); (This query will work)
    ```

#### Sub-queries in List of Columns
Substitute a column name with a sub-query, known as a **Column Expression**.

* **Example**:
    ```sql
    SELECT title (SELECT MAX(pages) FROM Book) AS MaxPages FROM Book; (This query retrieves the title of the book and the maximum number of pages in the Book table)
    ```

#### Sub-queries in `FROM` Clause
Substitute a table name with a sub-query, known as a **Derived Table** or **Table Expression**.

* **Example**:
    ```sql
    SELECT title FROM (SELECT * FROM Book) AS B; (This query retrieves the title of the book in the Book table)
    ```

### 3) Querying Multiple Tables

There are several ways to access multiple tables in a single query, such as sub-queries, implicit joins, and join operators (`INNER JOIN`, `OUTER JOIN`, etc.).

#### Sub-queries
Let's consider the following example:

* **Book table**: `BOOK_ID`, `TITLE`, `PAGES`, `COST`, `PUBLISH_DATE`, `AUTHOR_ID`
    * `[1, 'The Great Gatsby', 300, 12.99, '1925-04-10', 1]`, `[2, 'Pride and Prejudice', 400, 14.99, '1813-01-28', 2]`
* **Author table**: `AUTHOR_ID`, `FIRSTNAME`, `LASTNAME`, `COUNTRY`, `BIRTH_DATE`
    * `[1, 'F. Scott', 'Fitzgerald', 'USA', '1896-09-24']`, `[2, 'Jane', 'Austen', 'UK', '1775-12-16']`

* **Example #1**: This query retrieves all the rows in the `Book` table where the `AUTHOR_ID` exists in the `Author` table.
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM Book WHERE AUTHOR_ID IN (SELECT AUTHOR_ID FROM Author);
    ```

* **Example #2**: This query retrieves all the rows in the `Book` table where the `AUTHOR_ID` exists in the `Author` table and the `COUNTRY` is 'USA'.
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM Book WHERE AUTHOR_ID IN (SELECT AUTHOR_ID FROM Author WHERE COUNTRY = 'USA');
    ```

* **Example #3**: This query retrieves the `AUTHOR_ID` and `TITLE` of the books in the `Book` table where the `AUTHOR_ID` exists in the `Author` table and the `BIRTH_DATE` is before '1800-01-01'.
    ```sql
    SELECT AUTHOR_ID, TITLE FROM Book WHERE AUTHOR_ID IN (SELECT AUTHOR_ID FROM Author WHERE BIRTH_DATE < '1800-01-01');
    ```

#### Implicit Joins
Specify multiple tables in the `FROM` clause, resulting in a **full join** or **Cartesian join**.

* **Example**:
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM Book, Author;
    ```

Use additional operands to limit the result set.

* **Example**: This query retrieves all rows in the `Book` table where the `AUTHOR_ID` matches in the `Author` table.
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM Book, Author WHERE Book.AUTHOR_ID = Author.AUTHOR_ID;
    ```

Use **aliases** to simplify the query.

* **Example #1**:
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM Book B, Author A WHERE B.AUTHOR_ID = A.AUTHOR_ID;
    ```

* **Example #2**:
    ```sql
    SELECT AUTHOR_ID, TITLE FROM Book B, Author A WHERE B.AUTHOR_ID = A.AUTHOR_ID;
    ```

## 3. Conclusion

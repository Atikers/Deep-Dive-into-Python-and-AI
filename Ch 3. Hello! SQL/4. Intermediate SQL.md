# Intermediate SQL

## 1. Refining Results

### 1) Using String Patterns, Ranges, and Sets of Values

#### Retrieving rows from a table
* The SQL SELECT statement retrieves rows from a table.
sql
    Syntax : SELECT column_name FROM table_name;    
    Example : SELECT book_id, title FROM book; (and you can WHERE clause to restrains the rows)


#### Retrieving rows - using a String Pattern
* If you can't remember the exact value of a column, you can use a string pattern to retrieve rows.
* You can remember the first letter of the title of the book like ***The***, you can use **The%** to retrieve rows.
sql
    Example : SELECT book_id, title FROM book WHERE title LIKE 'The%';
`

#### Retrieving rows - using a Range
* You can use a range to retrieve rows.
* you can use operators like **>** (greater than), **<** (less than), **>=** (greater than or equal to), **<=** (less than or equal to) to retrieve rows.
* And you can also use **BETWEEN** operator to retrieve rows.
```sql
    Example : SELECT book_id, title FROM book WHERE pages >= 300 AND pages <= 400; 
    Example : SELECT book_id, title FROM book WHERE pages BETWEEN 300 AND 400;
```

#### Retrieving rows - using Sets of Values
* You can use a set of values to retrieve rows.
* If you use the **OR** operator, you can retrieve rows that match any of the values in the set.
```sql
    Example : SELECT firstname, lastname, country from Author WHERE country = 'USA' `OR` country = 'UK';
```
* If you use the **IN** operator, you can retrieve rows that match any of the values in the set.
```sql
    Example : SELECT firstname, lastname, country from Author WHERE country IN ('USA', 'UK');
```

### 2) Sorting Result sets
* Basically, SELECT statement retrieves rows in the order they were inserted into the table.
* For example, if you run the below query, the rows will be retrieved in the order they were inserted into the table.
```sql
    SELECT book_id, title FROM book
```
* And you can sort the result set by using the `ORDER BY` clause.
```sql
    Syntax : SELECT column_name FROM table_name ORDER BY column_name ASC|DESC;
    Example : SELECT book_id, title FROM book ORDER BY title ASC;
```
> ASC : Ascending order    
> DESC : Descending order

### 3) Grouping Result Sets

#### Eliminating Duplicates - using the `DISTINCT`, `GROUP BY` clause 
* If you want to eliminate duplicates from the result set, you can use the `DISTINCT` clause.
* For example, if you run the query SELECT country FROM Author, the result set will contain duplicates. e.g. USA, USA, UK, USA, UK, UK...
* But if you run the query SELECT DISTINCT` country FROM Author, the result set will not contain duplicates. e.g. USA, UK.
```sql
    Syntax : SELECT DISTINCT column_name FROM table_name;
    Example : SELECT DISTINCT country FROM Author;
```
* You can also use the `GROUP BY` clause to group rows that have the same values in a column.
```sql
    Example : SELECT country, COUNT(*) FROM Author GROUP BY country;
```

#### Restricting the Result Set - using the `HAVING` clause
* You can use the `HAVING` clause to restrict the result set.
* For example, if you want to retrieve rows where the number of rows in each group is greater than 1, you can use the `HAVING` clause.
```sql
    Syntax : SELECT column_name, COUNT(*) FROM table_name GROUP BY column_name HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
    Example : SELECT country, COUNT(*) FROM Author GROUP BY country HAVING COUNT(*) > 1; 
```

## 2. Functions, Sub-queries, Multiple Tables

### 1) Built-in Database Functions

#### Built-in Database Functions
* Built-in functions can be included as part of SQL statements.
* Database functions can significantly reduce the amount of data that needs to be retrieved from the database. ***Time is gold!***
* Let's consider Book table:
    * BOOK_ID(INTEGER), TITLE(VARCHAR(20)), PAGES(INTEGER), COST(DECIMAL(5,2)), PUBLISH_DATE(DATE)
    * Example : This query retrieves the number of rows in the Book table
    ```sql
        SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Book; 
    ```
* Aggregate or Column functions    

    ```sql
    SUM(column_name) : Add up all the values in a column
        Syntax : SELECT SUM(column_name) FROM table_name;
        Example : SELECT SUM(pages) FROM Book;
        You can also explicityl name the column in the result set. e.g. SELECT SUM(pages) AS TotalPages FROM Book;
    AVG(column_name) : Calculate the average of the values in a column
        Syntax : SELECT AVG(column_name) FROM table_name;
        Example : SELECT AVG(pages) FROM Book;
    ```
    You can perform mathematical operations between columns.
    ```sql
        Example : SELECT AVG(cost/pages) FROM Book;
    ```
    ```sql
    MIN(column_name), MAX(column_name) : Return the minimum or maximum value in a column
        Syntax : SELECT MIN(column_name) FROM table_name;
        Example : SELECT MIN(cost) FROM Book;
    ```
    You can also use the `WHERE` clause to restrict the rows.
    ```sql
        Example : SELECT MIN(cost) FROM Book WHERE pages > 300;
    ```
* SCALAR and STRING functions    

    SCALAR functions perform operations on every input value. e.g. ROUND, LENGTH, UCASE, LCASE, etc.
    ```sql
    ROUND(column_name) : Round the values in a column
        Syntax : SELECT ROUND(column_name) FROM table_name;
        Example : SELECT ROUND(cost) FROM Book;    

    LENGTH(column_name) : Return the length of the values in a column
        Syntax : SELECT LENGTH(column_name) FROM table_name;
        Example : SELECT LENGTH(title) FROM Book;
    ```
    UCASE(column_name), LCASE(column_name) : Convert the values in a column to uppercase or lowercase
    ```sql
        Syntax : SELECT UCASE(column_name) FROM table_name;
        Example : SELECT UCASE(title) FROM Book;
    ```
    You can also use the `WHERE` clause to restrict the rows.
    ```sql
        Example : SELECT UCASE(title) FROM Book WHERE pages > 300;
    ```
    And you can also use the `DISTINCT` clause to eliminate duplicates.
    ```sql
        Example : SELECT DISTINCT UCASE(title) FROM Book;
    ```
* DATE and TIME functions
    * Most databases contain special data types for storing dates and times.
    * `DATE` - YYYYMMDD(8digits), `TIME` - HHMMSS(6digits), `TIMESTAMP` - YYYYXXDDHHMMSSZZZZZZ(20digits, XX : month, ZZZZZZ : milliseconds)
    * Date/Time functions:
        * `DAY`, `MONTH`, `YEAR` : Extract the day, month, or year from a date.
        ```sql
            Syntax : SELECT DAY(column_name) FROM table_name;
            Example : SELECT DAY(publish_date) FROM Book;
            Example : SELECT DAY(publish_date) FROM Book WHERE pages > 300;
        ```
        * `DATE_ADD`, `DATE_SUB` : Add or subtract a value from a date.
        ```sql
            Syntax : SELECT DATE_ADD(column_name, INTERVAL value unit) FROM table_name;
            Example : SELECT DATE_ADD(publish_date, INTERVAL 1 DAY) FROM Book;
        ```
        * `DATE_DIFF` : Calculate the difference between two dates.
        ```sql
            Syntax : SELECT DATE_DIFF(CURRENT_DATE, column_name) FROM table_name;
            Example : SELECT DATE_DIFF(CURRENT_DATE, publish_date) FROM Book;
        ```
        > `CURRENT_DATE` is a built-in function that returns the current date.    

        * `FROM_DAYS` : function to present the output in a YYYYMMDD format.
        ```sql
            Example : SELECT FROM_DAYS`(DATE_DIFF(CURRENT_DATE, publish_date)) FROM Book;
        ```

### 2) Sub-queries : Overcoming Limitations of Aggregate Functions
A sub-query is a query within another query.
Because we cannot evaluate Aggregate Functions in the `WHERE` clause, we use sub-queries to evaluate Aggregate functions in the `WHERE` clause.
Example :    
```sql
SELECT title FROM Book WHERE pages = MAX(pages); (This query will not work) 
SELECT title FROM Book WHERE pages = (SELECT MAX(pages) FROM Book); (This query will work)
```

#### Sub-queries in list of columns
Substitute column name with a sub-query. It is called **Column Expression**.
```sql
Example : SELECT title, (SELECT MAX(pages) FROM Book) AS MaxPages FROM Book; (This query retrieves the title of the book and the maximum number of pages in the Book table)
```

#### Sub-queries in FROM clause
Substitute table name with a sub-query. It is called **Derived Table** or **Table Expression**.
```sql
Example : SELECT title FROM (SELECT * FROM Book) AS B; (This query retrieves the title of the book in the book table)
```

### 3) Querying Multiple Tables

there are several ways to access multiple tables in a single query.
Sub-queries, Implicit Joins, Join operators(`INNER JOIN`, `OUTER JOIN`, etc)

#### Sub-queries
Let's consider the following example:
* Book table : BOOK_ID, TITLE, PAGES, COST, PUBLISH_DATE, AUTHOR_ID    
    * [1, 'The Great Gatsby', 300, 12.99, '1925-04-10', 1], [2, 'Pride and Prejudice', 400, 14.99, '1813-01-28', 2]
* Author table : AUTHOR_ID, FIRSTNAME, LASTNAME, COUNTRY, BIRTH_DATE    
    * [1, 'F. Scott', 'Fitzgerald', 'USA', '1896-09-24'], [2, 'Jane', 'Austen', 'UK', '1775-12-16']
* Example #1 : This query retrieves all the rows in the Book table where the AUTHOR_ID is in the Author table
```sql
    SELECT * FROM Book WHERE AUTHOR_ID IN (SELECT AUTHOR_ID FROM Author);    
```
* Example #2 : This query retrieves all the rows in the Book table where the AUTHOR_ID is in the Author table and the COUNTRY is 'USA'
```sql
    SELECT * FROM Book WHERE AUTHOR_ID IN (SELECT AUTHOR_ID FROM Author WHERE COUNTRY = 'USA'); 
```
* Exmaple #3 : This query retrieves the AUTHOR_ID and TITLE of the book in the Book table where the AUTHOR_ID is in the Author table and the BIRTH_DATE is before '1800-01-01'
```sql
    SELECT AUTHOR_ID, TITLE FROM Book WHERE AUTHOR_ID IN (SELECT AUTHOR_ID FROM Author WHERE BIRTH_DATE < '1800-01-01'); 
```

#### Implicit Joins
Specify multiple tables in the FROM clause. The result is called a **full join** or **Cartesian join**
```sql
    Example :    
    SELECT * FROM Book, Author; 
```
Use additional operands to limit the reslut set:    
```sql
    Example : This query retrieves all the rows in the Book table where the AUTHOR_ID is in the Author table
    SELECT * FROM Book, Author WHERE Book.AUTHOR_ID = Author.AUTHOR_ID; 
```
Use **aliases** to simplify the query:
```sql
    Example #1 : SELECT * FROM Book B, Author A WHERE B.AUTHOR_ID = A.AUTHOR_ID;
    Example #2 : SELECT AUTHOR_ID, TITLE FROM Book B, Author A WHERE B.AUTHOR_ID = A.AUTHOR_ID;
```

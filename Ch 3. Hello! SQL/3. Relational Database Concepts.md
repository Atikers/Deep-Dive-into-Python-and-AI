# Introduction to Relational Databases and Tables

## 1. Relational Databases Concepts
Most used data model in the world
> Other data models : Hierarchical, Network, Object-Oriented, Document-based, Graph-based    
> **Hierarchical and Network** are not used anymore    
> **Object-Oriented** is used in some applications. E.g. Java    
> **Document-based** is used in some applications. E.g. MongoDB    
> **Graph-based** is used in some applications. E.g. Neo4j    
> **Relational** is the most used data model in the world. Because it is simple and powerful. E.g. MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Oracle, SQL Server    

Allows for data independence. This means that the data is stored in a way that is independent of the applications that use it.
Data is stored in tables, with rows and columns.
> Let's think about the following concepts:    
> Logical Data Independence - The ability to change the logical schema without changing the application    
> Physical Data Independence - The ability to change the physical schema without changing the application    
> Physical Storage Independence - The ability to change the physical storage without changing the application    

the key advantage of the relational model is **data independence**. This means that the data is stored in a way that is independent of the applications that use it. This allows for the data to be stored in a way that is optimized for storage and retrieval, without having to worry about how the data will be used by the applications that access it.

### 1) Entity-Relationship Model
Used as a tool to design the relational databases
* Entities : Objects or concepts that we want to store data about.
* Attributes : Characteristics of the entities.
E.g. **Book** entity with attributes **title**, **author**, **year**, **isbn**, **publisher**, **pages**, **price**.
    
### 2) Mapping Entity Diagrams to Tables
* Entities become tables
* Attributes become columns
E.g. Named **Book** table with columns **title**, **author**, **year**, **isbn**, **publisher**, **pages**, **price**.
> `char` : Fixed-length character data type. e.g. `char(2)` means that the column will store a string with a fixed length of 2 characters.
> `varchar` : Variable-length character data type. e.g. `varchar(24)` means that the column will store a string with a maximum length of 24 characters. 

### 3) Primary Keys and Foreign Keys
* **Primary key** : A column that uniquely identifies each row in a table. Let's think about the 'Author' table. The primary key is the 'Author_id' column. So, the 'Author_id' column is unique for each author. There is no two authors with the same 'Author_id'. Duplicate primary key values are not allowed. By analogy, the 'Author_id' column is like a social security number. Each person has a unique social security number. The 'Author_id' column is used to uniquely identify each author in the 'Author' table.
* **Foreign key** : A column that is a primary key in another table. Let's think about the 'Book' table. The 'Author_id' column is a foreign key in the 'Book' table. The 'Author_id' column in the 'Book' table is a primary key in the 'Author' table. The 'Author_id' column in the 'Book' table is used to link the 'Book' table to the 'Author' table. By analogy, the 'Author_id' column in the 'Book' table is like a social security number. The 'Author_id' column in the 'Book' table is used to link each book to an author in the 'Author' table.

## 2. Types of SQL Statements(DDL vs. DML)
SQL Statement types : Data Definition Language(DDL) and Data Manipulation Language(DML)
* **DDL** : Used to **define, change, drop** the data. e.g. `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`, `TRUNCATE`. It is like building a house.
    * `CREATE TABLE` : Used to create a new table.
    * `ALTER TABLE` : Used to modify an existing table.
    * `DROP TABLE` : Used to delete a table.
    * `TRUNCATE TABLE` : Used to delete all rows from a table.
* **DML** : Used to **retrieve, insert, update, delete** data. e.g. `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`. It is like moving furniture into the house.
    * `SELECT` : Used to retrieve data from a table.
    * `INSERT INTO` : Used to insert new rows into a table.
    * `UPDATE` : Used to update existing rows in a table.
    * `DELETE` : Used to delete rows from a table.

## 3. CREATE TABLE Statement
The `CREATE TABLE` statement is used to create a new table in a database. And it is followed by the name of the table and a list of columns and their data types.
* Syntax form : `CREATE TABLE` table_name    
        (   
            column1_name data_type,     
            column2_name data_type,     
            ...     
            columnN_name data_type      
        );  
* e.g. Create a table for Canadian provinces
    * `CREATE TABLE` provinces    
        (    
            id char(2) PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,    
            name varchar(24)        
        )    
        Then, I get the following table :

* **Not Null** : A constraint that specifies that a column cannot contain null values. If you try to insert a row with a null value in a column that has the not null constraint, you will get an error.
* Create a table for books
    * `CREATE TABLE` books    
        (       
            author_id CHAR(2) PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,    
            lastname VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL,    
            firstname VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL,    
            email VARCHAR(40),    
            city VARCHAR(15),    
            country CHAR(2)    
        )
    * Primary key : author_id - A column that uniquely identifies each row in a table.
    * Not Null : lastname, firstname - A constraint that specifies that a column cannot contain null values.

## 4. ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE TABLE Statement
### 1) ALTER TABLE Statement
The `ALTER TABLE` statement is used to add or remove columns, modify the data type of columns, or add or remove constraints to an existing table. And it is followed by the name of the table, and the action to be performed.
* Syntax form :    
        `ALTER TABLE` table_name    
        `ADD` column_name data_type;    
        `DROP` column_name;    
        `MODIFY` column_name data_type;    
* Example : 
        `ALTER TABLE` books    
        `ADD` birthdate DATE;   (For adding a new column 'birthdate' with the data type 'DATE')    
        `DROP` email;   (For deleting the 'email' column)
        `MODIFY` city VARCHAR(20);  (For changing the data type of the 'city' column to 'VARCHAR(20)')

### 2) TRUNCATE TABLE Statement
The `TRUNCATE TABLE` statement is used to delete the data in a table rather than deleting the table itself.
The `TRUNCATE TABLE` statement is followed by the name of the table.
* Syntax form :    
        `TRUNCATE TABLE` table_name;
* Example :
        `TRUNCATE TABLE` books;   (For deleting all rows from the 'books' table)

# Basic SQL Statements

## 1. CREATE TABLE Statement
* We use `CREATE TABLE` statement to create a new table in a database.
* It is used to create a new table in a database.
* Syntax form of CREATE TABLE statement: `CREATE TABLE <table_name> (<column_name> <data_type> <constraint>, <column_name> <data_type> <constraint>, ...);`. E.g. `CREATE TABLE book (book_id INT PRIMARY KEY, title VARCHAR(100), edition INT, year INT, price DECIMAL(5, 2), ISBN VARCHAR(20), pages INT, aisle VARCHAR(10), description TEXT);`
* We can specify the data type and constraints for each column in the table.

## 2. SELECT Statement
* After creating a table and inserting data into the table, we want to see the data.
* We use `SELECT` statement to see the data : A Data Manipulation Language (DML) statement are used to read and modify data.
* SELECT statement is called a ***query***.
* Result of a query is called a ***result set***.
* Syntax form of SELECT statement: `SELECT * FROM <table_name>`. E.g. `SELECT book_id, title, edition, year, price, ISBN, pages, aisle, description from book;`
* We can retrieve just the colmns we want by specifying the column names in the SELECT statement. E.g. `SELECT title, price FROM book;`

### WHERE Clause
* We can filter the rows in the result set by using `WHERE` clause.
* Always requires Predicate (condition) to filter the rows.
* Syntax form of WHERE clause: `SELECT * FROM <table_name> WHERE <predicate>`. E.g. `SELECT title, price FROM book WHERE price > 100;`
* We can use logical operators like `AND`, `OR`, `NOT` in the WHERE clause. And We can also use comparison operators like `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` in the WHERE clause. E.g. `SELECT title, price FROM book WHERE price > 100 AND year > 2010;`

## 3. COUNT, DISTNCT, LIMIT Statements

### 1) COUNT Statement
* We can use `COUNT` statement to count the number of rows in a table. 
* It is used to count the number of rows in a table.
* Syntax form of COUNT statement: `SELECT COUNT <column_name> FROM <table_name>;`. E.g. `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM book;`
* We can also use `WHERE` clause with `COUNT` statement to count the number of rows that meet a specific condition. E.g. `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM book WHERE price > 100;`

### 2) DISTINCT Statement
* We can use `DISTINCT` statement to retrieve unique values from a column.
* It is used to remove duplicate values from the result set.
* Syntax form of DISTINCT statement: `SELECT DISTINCT <column_name> FROM <table_name>;`. E.g. `SELECT DISTINCT year FROM book;`
* We can also use `WHERE` clause with `DISTINCT` statement to retrieve unique values that meet a specific condition. E.g. `SELECT DISTINCT year FROM book WHERE price > 100;`

### 3) LIMIT Statement
* We can use `LIMIT` statement to limit the number of rows in the result set.
* It is used to limit the number of rows returned by a query.
* Syntax form of LIMIT statement: `SELECT * FROM <table_name> LIMIT <number_of_rows>;`. E.g. `SELECT * FROM book LIMIT 5;`
* We can also use `WHERE` clause with `LIMIT` statement to limit the number of rows that meet a specific condition. E.g. `SELECT * FROM book WHERE price > 100 LIMIT 5;`

## 4. INSERT Statement
* We use `INSERT` statement to insert data into a table.
* It is used to insert new rows into a table.
* Syntax form of INSERT statement: `INSERT INTO <table_name> (<column_name>, <column_name>, ...) VALUES (<value>, <value>, ...);`. E.g. `INSERT INTO book (book_id, title, edition, year, price, ISBN, pages, aisle, description) VALUES (1, 'Python Programming', 3, 2019, 29.99, '978-0-13-444432-1', 600, 'Programming', 'Learn Python Programming');`
* We can insert data into specific columns by specifying the column names in the INSERT statement. E.g. `INSERT INTO book (title, price) VALUES ('Java Programming', 39.99);`

## 5. UPDATE, DELETE Statements

### 1) UPDATE Statement
* We use `UPDATE` statement to update data in a table.
* It is used to modify existing rows in a table.
* Syntax form of UPDATE statement: `UPDATE <table_name> SET <column_name> = <value>, <column_name> = <value>, ... WHERE <predicate>;`. E.g. `UPDATE book SET price = 19.99 WHERE title = 'Python Programming';`
* We can update multiple columns in a single UPDATE statement. E.g. `UPDATE book SET price = 19.99, edition = 4 WHERE title = 'Python Programming';`

### 2) DELETE Statement
* We use `DELETE` statement to delete data from a table.
* It is used to remove existing rows from a table.
* Syntax form of DELETE statement: `DELETE FROM <table_name> WHERE <predicate>;`. E.g. `DELETE FROM book WHERE title = 'Python Programming';`
* We can delete all rows in a table by omitting the WHERE clause. E.g. `DELETE FROM book;`

# Basic SQL Statements

We can manage data in a database using SQL (Structured Query Language). SQL is the standard language for storing, manipulating, and retrieving data in databases. It is used to communicate with a database and perform various operations such as creating a database, creating tables, inserting data into tables, updating data, deleting data, and querying data. On this page, we will learn about some basic SQL statements.

## 1. `CREATE TABLE` Statement

Let's start with the `CREATE TABLE` statement. Whether it's an extensive database or a small one, everything begins with creating a table. This command is used to create a new table in a database.

* **Syntax**:
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE <table_name> (
        <column_name> <data_type> <constraint>,
        <column_name> <data_type> <constraint>,
        ...
    );
    ```

* **Example**:
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE book (
        book_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
        title VARCHAR(100),
        edition INT,
        year INT,
        price DECIMAL(5, 2),
        ISBN VARCHAR(20),
        pages INT,
        aisle VARCHAR(10),
        description TEXT
    );
    ```
    > Whtat is CHAR, VARCHAR, DECIMAL, INT?
    > - `CHAR(n)`: Fixed-length character string with a maximum length of `n` characters.
    > - `VARCHAR(n)`: Variable-length character string with a maximum length of `n` characters.
    > - `DECIMAL(p, s)`: Exact numeric value with a precision of `p` total digits and `s` digits after the decimal point.
    > - `INT`: Integer data type.

## 2. `SELECT` Statement

After creating a table and inserting data into it, we often want to retrieve and view the data. The `SELECT` statement allows us to see the data. It is part of SQL's Data Manipulation Language (DML), which is used to read and modify data.

* **Syntax**:
    ```sql
    SELECT <columns> FROM <table_name>;
    ```

* **Example**:
    ```sql
    SELECT book_id, title, edition, year, price, ISBN, pages, aisle, description FROM book;
    ```

### `WHERE` Clause

We can filter the rows in the result set by using the `WHERE` clause, which always requires a predicate (condition) to filter the rows.

* **Syntax**:
    ```sql
    SELECT <columns> FROM <table_name> WHERE <condition>;
    ```

* **Example**:
    ```sql
    SELECT title, price FROM book WHERE price > 100;
    ```

We can use logical operators like `AND`, `OR`, `NOT` and comparison operators like `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` in the `WHERE` clause.

* **Example**:
    ```sql
    SELECT title, price FROM book WHERE price > 100 AND year > 2010;
    ```

## 3. `COUNT`, `DISTINCT`, `LIMIT` Statements

### 1) `COUNT` Statement

The `COUNT` statement is used to count the number of rows in a table.

* **Example**:
    ```sql
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM book;
    ```
    > The `*` is a wildcard character that represents all columns in a table. So, `COUNT(*)` counts the number of rows in a table.

* **Example**: you can also count the number of rows in a specific column by specifying the column name in the `COUNT` statement.
    ```sql
    SELECT COUNT(title) FROM book;
    ```

You can also use the `WHERE` clause with the `COUNT` statement to count the number of rows that meet a specific condition.

* **Example**:
    ```sql
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM book WHERE price > 100;
    ```

* **Example**: you can count the number of rows that have non-null values in specific columns.
    ```sql
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM book WHERE title IS NOT NULL AND price IS NOT NULL;
    ```

### 2) `DISTINCT` Statement

The `DISTINCT` statement retrieves unique values from a column, removing duplicate values from the result set.

* **Syntax**:
    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT <column_name> FROM <table_name>;
    ```

* **Example**:
    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT Author_ID FROM book;
    ```

You can also use the `WHERE` clause with the `DISTINCT` statement to retrieve unique values that meet a specific condition.

* **Example**:
    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT Author_ID FROM book WHERE price > 100;
    ```

### 3) `LIMIT` Statement

The `LIMIT` statement limits the number of rows returned by a query.

* **Syntax**:
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM <table_name> LIMIT <number_of_rows>;
    ```

* **Example**:
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM book LIMIT 5;
    ```

You can also use the `WHERE` clause with the `LIMIT` statement to limit the number of rows that meet a specific condition.

* **Example**:
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM book WHERE price > 100 LIMIT 5;
    ```

## 4. `INSERT` Statement

The `INSERT` statement is used to insert new rows into a table.

* **Syntax**:
    ```sql
    INSERT INTO <table_name> (<column_name>, <column_name>, ...) VALUES (<value>, <value>, ...);
    ```

* **Example**:
    ```sql
    INSERT INTO book (
        book_id, title, edition, year, price, ISBN, pages, aisle, description
    ) VALUES (
        1, 'Python Programming', 3, 2019, 29.99, '978-0-13-444432-1', 600, 'Programming', 'Learn Python Programming'
    );
    ```

You can insert data into specific columns by specifying the column names in the `INSERT` statement.

* **Example**:
    ```sql
    INSERT INTO book (title, price) VALUES ('Java Programming', 39.99);
    ```

## 5. `UPDATE` and `DELETE` Statements

### 1) `UPDATE` Statement

The `UPDATE` statement is used to modify existing rows in a table.

* **Syntax**:
    ```sql
    UPDATE <table_name> SET <column_name> = <value>, <column_name> = <value>, ... WHERE <condition>;
    ```

* **Example**:
    ```sql
    UPDATE book SET price = 19.99 WHERE title = 'Python Programming';
    ```

You can update multiple columns in a single `UPDATE` statement.

* **Example**:
    ```sql
    UPDATE book SET price = 19.99, edition = 4 WHERE title = 'Python Programming';
    ```

> **What is the difference between `INSERT` and `UPDATE` statements?**  
> The `INSERT` statement is used to insert new rows into a table, whereas the `UPDATE` statement is used to modify existing rows in a table.  
> So, `UPDATE` doesn't change the number of rows, just the values within those rows.  
> **Important:** The `UPDATE` statement always requires a `WHERE` clause to specify which rows to update. If you forget the `WHERE` clause, all rows in the table will be updated.

### 2) `DELETE` Statement

The `DELETE` statement is used to remove existing rows from a table.

* **Syntax**:
    ```sql
    DELETE FROM <table_name> WHERE <condition>;
    ```

* **Example**:
    ```sql
    DELETE FROM book WHERE title = 'Python Programming';
    ```

You can delete all rows in a table by omitting the `WHERE` clause.

* **Example**:
    ```sql
    DELETE FROM book;
    ```

# Basic SQL Statements

We can manage data in a database using SQL (Structured Query Language). SQL is the standard language for storing, manipulating, and retrieving data in databases. It is used to communicate with a database and perform various operations such as creating a database, creating tables, inserting data into tables, updating data, deleting data, and querying data. On this page, we will learn about some basic SQL statements.

## 1. CREATE TABLE Statement
Alright, letâ€™s start with the 'CREATE TABLE' statement. Whether it's an extensive database or a very small one, everything begins with creating a TABLE. It is used to create a new table in a database.    
* Syntax form of CREATE TABLE statement :    
```sql
CREATE TABLE <table_name> (<column_name> <data_type> <constraint>, <column_name> <data_type>     <constraint>, ...);    
```
* Example :    
```sql
CREATE TABLE book (book_id INT PRIMARY KEY, title VARCHAR(100), edition INT, year INT, price DECIMAL(5, 2), ISBN VARCHAR(20), pages INT, aisle VARCHAR(10), description TEXT);    
```

## 2. SELECT Statement
After creating a table and inserting data into the table, we want to see the data(I will explain the statement used for inserting data later on this page). 
We use `SELECT` statement to see the data : The `SELECT` statement is part of SQL's Data Manipulation Language (DML), which is used to read and modify data.
* Syntax form of SELECT statement :    
```sql
SELECT FROM <table_name>;
```
* Example :    
```sql
SELECT book_id, title, edition, year, price, ISBN, pages, aisle, description FROM book;    
```

We can retrieve just the colmns we want by specifying the column names in the SELECT statement.    
* Example :    
```sql
SELECT title, price FROM book;
```

#### WHERE Clause
We can filter the rows in the result set by using WHERE clause.    
Always requires predicate (condition) to filter the rows.    
* Syntax form of WHERE clause:    
```sql
SELECT * FROM <table_name> WHERE <predicate>
```

* Example :    
```sql
SELECT title, price FROM book WHERE price > 100;    
```

We can use logical operators like `AND`, `OR`, `NOT` in the `WHERE` clause. And We can also use comparison operators like `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` in the WHERE clause.
* Example :    
```sql
SELECT title, price FROM book WHERE price > 100 AND year > 2010;
```

## 3. COUNT, DISTNCT, LIMIT Statements

### 1) COUNT Statement
We can use `COUNT` statement to count the number of rows in a table. It is used to count the number of rows in a table.
* Syntax form of COUNT statement:    
```sql
SELECT COUNT <column_name> FROM <table_name>;
```
* Example :    
```sql
SELECT COUNT * FROM book;    
```

We can also use `WHERE` clause with `COUNT` statement to count the number of rows that meet a specific condition.    
* Example :    
```sql
SELECT COUNT * FROM book WHERE price > 100;
```

### 2) DISTINCT Statement
We can use `DISTINCT` statement to retrieve unique values from a column.
It is used to remove duplicate values from the result set.
* Syntax form of DISTINCT statement :    
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT <column_name> FROM <table_name>;
```
* Example :    
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT year FROM book;    
```

We can also use `WHERE` clause with `DISTINCT` statement to retrieve unique values that meet a specific condition.    
* Example :    
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT year FROM book WHERE price > 100;
```

### 3) LIMIT Statement
We can use `LIMIT` statement to limit the number of rows in the result set.
It is used to limit the number of rows returned by a query.
* Syntax form of LIMIT statement :    
```sql
SELECT * FROM <table_name> LIMIT <number_of_rows>;
```
* Example :    
```sql
SELECT * FROM book LIMIT 5;    
```

We can also use `WHERE` clause with `LIMIT` statement to limit the number of rows that meet a specific condition.
* Example :    
```sql
SELECT * FROM book WHERE price > 100 LIMIT 5;
```

## 4. INSERT Statement
We use `INSERT` statement to insert data into a table.
It is used to insert new rows into a table.
* Syntax form of INSERT statement :    
```sql
INSERT INTO <table_name> (<column_name>, <column_name>, ...) VALUES (<value>, <value>, ...);
```
* Example :    
```sql
INSERT INTO book (book_id, title, edition, year, price, ISBN, pages, aisle, description) VALUES (1, Python Programming, 3, 2019, 29.99, '978-0-13-444432-1', 600, 'Programming', 'Learn Python Programming');
```

We can insert data into specific columns by specifying the column names in the INSERT statement.
* Example :    
```sql
INSERT INTO book (title, price) VALUES ('Java Programming', 39.99);
```

## 5. UPDATE, DELETE Statements

### 1) UPDATE Statement
We use `UPDATE` statement to update data in a table.
It is used to modify existing rows in a table.
* Syntax form of UPDATE statement :
```sql 
UPDATE <table_name> SET <column_name> = <value>, <column_name> = <value>, ... WHERE <predicate>;
```
* Example :    
```sql
UPDATE book SET price = 19.99 WHERE title = 'Python Programming';    
```

We can update multiple columns in a single UPDATE statement.
* Example :  
```sql  
UPDATE book SET price = 19.99, edition = 4 WHERE title = 'Python Programming';
```

> **What is the difference between `INSERT` and `UPDATE` statements?**    
> `INSERT` statement is used to insert new rows into a table, whereas `UPDATE` statement is used to modify existing rows in a table.
> So, `UPDATE` statement doesn't change the number of rows, just the values with those rows.
> Oh don't forget! `UPDATE` statement always requires a `WHERE` clause to specify which rows to update. If you forget the `WHERE` clause, all rows in the table will be updated.

### 2) DELETE Statement
We use `DELETE` statement to delete data from a table.
It is used to remove existing rows from a table.
* Syntax form of DELETE statement :    
```sql
DELETE FROM <table_name> WHERE <predicate>;
```
* Example :    
```sql
DELETE FROM book WHERE title = 'Python Programming';    
```

We can delete all rows in a table by omitting the WHERE clause.    
* Example :    
```sql
DELETE FROM book;
```

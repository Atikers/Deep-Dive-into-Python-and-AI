# Basic SQL

## 1. Introduction to **SQL**, **Database** and **DBMS**

### 1) What is SQL?

You've probably heard about **SQL(Structured Query Languge)**. What is it? and why do we learn it? why is **SQL** important for understanding **AI**?    

**SQL** is a language. Just as **Python** is a language, **SQL** is also a language. In the real world, being bilingual(or multilingual) is an advantage, and the same applies to programming languages.

SQL is used for working with relational databases and querying data. It allows you to communicate with a **database**. SQL acts like a **key to access the database**, enabling you to manipulate the data within it. This is why **SQL** is important for understanding **AI**.    

**AI** is all about data. Data is the fuel for AI. AI algorithms need data to learn and make decisions. Data is stored in databases. SQL is used to access and manipulate this data. So, if you want to work with AI, you need to know SQL.    

### 2) What is Data?

Data is a collection of facts, such as numbers, words, measurements, observations or just descriptions of things. It is called **new gold** in nowadays. Because Data is valuable and can be used to make decisions, solve problems, and create new products and services.  
Data is needed to be secured, stored, and managed properly. 
Data is like a **piece of paper**. It can be stored in a database, which is like a file cabinet.

### 3) What is Database?
A database is a repository of data. It is a collection of related data that is stored in a structured format. It is used to store, manage, and retrieve data.   
Provides the functionality for adding, modifying, and querying data.    
Different types of databases are available, such as relational databases, NoSQL databases, etc. 
Database is like a **file cabinet**. It stores data in an organized manner.

* Reataional Database : Data stored in tabular form - columns and rows containing item properties e.g. Last Name, First Name, Address, etc. Table is collection of related things. Relationships can exist between tables. Hence : "Relational Database". Relational database is like a **file cabinet with multiple drawers**.

### 4) What is DBMS?
DBMS(Database Management System) is a software to manage databasses.    
It provides an interface for users and applications to interact with the database.  
Database, Database server, Database System, Data Server, DBMS are often used interchangeably.   
DBMS is used to create, manage, and maintain databases.    
DBMS is like a **person who manages the file cabinet**.

* RDBMS(Relational Database Management System) : A set of software tools that controls the data, access, organization, storage, and retrieval of data in a database. Examples : MySQL, Oracle Database, IBM DB2, Microsoft SQL Server, etc. RDBMS is like a **person who manages the file cabinet with multiple drawers**.


## 2. Basic SQL commands : `Create`, `Insert`, `Select`, `Update`, `Delete`
These commands are used to perform operations on the database.    
I will explain these commands at the next page.

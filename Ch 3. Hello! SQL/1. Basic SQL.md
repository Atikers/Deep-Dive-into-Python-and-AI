# Basic SQL

## 1. Introduction to **SQL**, Database and DBMS

### 1) What is SQL?
**SQL(Structured Query Languge)** is a language used for relational databases and querying data. It is used to communicate with the database.   

SQL is like a **key to access the database**.

### 2) What is Data?
Data is a collection of facts, such as numbers, words, measurements, observations or just descriptions of things. It is called **new gold** in nowadays. Because Data is valuable and can be used to make decisions, solve problems, and create new products and services.  
Data is needed to be secured, stored, and managed properly. 
Data is like a **piece of paper**. It can be stored in a database, which is like a file cabinet.

### 3) What is Database?
A database is a repository of data. It is a collection of related data that is stored in a structured format. It is used to store, manage, and retrieve data.   
Provides the functionality for adding, modifying, and querying data.    
Different types of databases are available, such as relational databases, NoSQL databases, etc. 
Database is like a **file cabinet**. It stores data in an organized manner.

* Reataional Database : Data stored in tabular form - columns and rows containing item properties e.g. Last Name, First Name, Address, etc. Table is collection of related things. Relationships can exist between tables. Hence : "Relational Database". Relational database is like a **file cabinet with multiple drawers**.

### 4) What is DBMS?
DBMS(Database Management System) is a software to manage databasses.    
It provides an interface for users and applications to interact with the database.  
Database, Database server, Database System, Data Server, DBMS are often used interchangeably.   
DBMS is used to create, manage, and maintain databases.    
DBMS is like a **person who manages the file cabinet**.

* RDBMS(Relational Database Management System) : A set of software tools that controls the data, access, organization, storage, and retrieval of data in a database. Examples : MySQL, Oracle Database, IBM DB2, Microsoft SQL Server, etc. RDBMS is like a **person who manages the file cabinet with multiple drawers**.


## 2. Basic SQL commands : `Create`, `Insert`, `Select`, `Update`, `Delete`
These commands are used to perform operations on the database.    
I will explain these commands at the next page.

# Analyzing Stock Performance and Building a Dashboard using yfinance library
## 1. Scenario
In the bustling city of Technopolis, a new startup investment firm named ***StellarInvest*** has emerged. Founded by a group of ambitious entrepreneurs, the firm aims to revolutionize how people invest their money in stocks by leveraging cutting-edge technology and data analysis. The founders believe that by providing insightful and accessible financial data, they can empower individuals to make informed investment decisions.    

***StellarInvest*** has recruited me as a data scientist, and I tasked with a critical project: developing a comprehensive dashboard that analyzes the performance of popular stocks. This dashboard will be used by customers to identify trends and make strategic investment choices. To start, the focus will be on : ***MICROSOFT(MSFT), NVIDIA(NVDA)***

I will extract financial data, including historical share prices and quarterly revenue reports, using Python libraries and web scraping techniques.

>A dashboard often provides a view of key performance indicators in a clear way.  
>Analyzing a data set and extracting key performance indicators will be practiced.  
>Prompts will be used to support learning in accessing and displaying data in dashboards.  
>Learning how to display key performance indicators on a dashboard will be included in this project.  
>I will be using Plotly in this project for data visualization.  

>**About Stock Shares**
>
>A company's stock share is a piece of the company.    
>
>A company's stock represents a fraction of ownership in that company.    
>If an investor owns a company's stock, they effectively own a portion of the entire company.    
>Therefore, if the company performs well financially, the value of the stock increases, and if the company performs poorly, the value of the stock decreases.    
>While many factors can influence the stock price, ultimately, the most critical factor in the long term is how well the company makes money.
>In other words, "the long-term stock price of a company converges to its fundamentals."
>In this project, I will process information related to a company's stock using Python in a very simple project.
>This project is not intended to predict future stock prices but to learn how to utilize the library.
>
>The **stock ticker** is a report of the price of a certain stock, updated continuously throughout the trading session by the various stock market exchanges. 
>In this project, I will use the `y-finance API` to obtain the stock ticker and extract information about the stock.

## 2. Setup

```python
!pip install yfinance            # Install the yfinance library for financial data
!pip install pandas              # Install the pandas library for data manipulation
!pip install matplotlib          # Install the matplotlib library for plotting
!pip install nbformat            # Install the nbformat library for Jupyter Notebook file handling
```
```python
import yfinance as yf            # Import the yfinance library for financial data
import pandas as pd              # Import the pandas library for data manipulation
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  # Import the matplotlib library for plotting
import os                        # Import the os library for operating system interactions
import json                      # Import the json library for JSON file handling
```
```python
%matplotlib inline               
```

## 3. Steps
### 1) Step 1 : Using the yfinance Library to Extract Stock Data
Using the `Ticker` module I can create an object that will allow me to access functions to extract data.    
To do this I need to provide the ticker symbol for the stock, here the company is ***MICROSOFT*** and the ticker symbol is ***MSFT***.    

```python
Microsoft=yf.Ticker("MSFT")   # For Creating a Ticker object for Microsoft using Yahoo Finance (ticker symbol: MSFT)
```
```python
Microsoft_info=Microsoft.info     # For Retrieving the information dictionary for Microsoft
```
```python
current_directory=os.getcwd()        # For Creating a variable to store the current working directory
print(f"Current working directory : {current_directory}")        # For Printing the current working directory
```
>**Why is this code needed? - Static Web Page and Dynamic Web Page**
>
>**Static Web Page**    
>A static web page is like a fixed signboard. Imagine a map or information board at the entrance of a park. This signboard always displays the same information, and to change it, someone has to manually replace it with a new sign. So, everyone who looks at this sign sees the same information all the time.
>
>**Dynamic Web Page**    
>A dynamic web page is like an interactive digital display. Think of an electronic billboard at a bus stop that updates with real-time bus schedules or weather information. The content on this billboard can change automatically based on different factors, such as the time of day, the weather, or the arrival of a bus. It provides different information to different people depending on the current situation.
>
>**Why is the `current_directory = os.getcwd()` Code Needed in Web Scraping a Dynamic Web Page?**    
>When performing web scraping on a dynamic web page, the content you need to scrape can change frequently, and you might be downloading multiple pieces of data or files during the scraping process. Knowing the current working directory (current_directory = os.getcwd()) is crucial for managing these files effectively.    
>
>This code helps you determine where your script is running and ensures that you can save or read files relative to this directory. This is particularly important for dynamic web pages because the data you scrape might need to be organized and stored efficiently in real-time. By knowing the current working directory, you can ensure that all downloaded files are saved in the correct location, making it easier to manage and access the data later. This organization is vital for handling the frequently changing content typical of dynamic web pages.

```python
json_file_path=os.path.join(current_directory, 'Mirosoft.json')        # For Creating a file path for 'Microsoft.json' in the current directory        
```
```python
with open(json_file_path, 'w') as json_file:        # For Saving the information to a JSON file.
    json.dump(Microsoft_info, json_file)
```
> What is **JSON** file?
>     
> Imagine you have a recipe book. Each recipe in the book contains various pieces of information: the name of the dish, a list of ingredients, the steps to prepare it, and additional notes. The recipe book is organized in a way that is easy to read and understand.
>     
> A **JSON** file is like a digital recipe book. It organizes and stores data in a structured format that is easy to read both for humans and machines.
> 
> Technically, JSON stands for **JavaScript Object Notation**. It is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. JSON is often used for transmitting data in web applications (e.g., sending some data from the server to the client so it can be displayed on a web page). A JSON file is a file that stores data in JSON format. The data is organized into key-value pairs, similar to how dictionaries work in Python. Here is a simple example of JSON data:    
> ```python
> {
>    "name": "Apple",
>    "ticker": "AAPL",
>    "price": 150.25,
>    "dividends": [0.22, 0.22, 0.22, 0.22],
>    "CEO": "Tim Cook"
>}
>```

**Stock Info**
Using the attribute `info` I can extract information about the stock as a python dictionary.
```python
with open(json_file_path) as json_file:
    Microsoft_info_loaded=json.load(json_file)        
print(Microsoft_info_loaded)                        # For Loading the information from the JSON file and printing.
```

### 2) Step 2 : Using the yfinance Library to Extract Share Price
A share is the single smallest part of a company's stock that I can buy, the prices of these shares fluctuate over time.    
Using the `history` method I can get the share price of the stock over a certain period of time.    
Using the `period` parameter I can set how far back from the present to get data.    
The options for `period` are 1 day as **1d**, **5d**, 1 month **1mo**, **3mo**, **6mo**, 1 year **1y**, **2y**, **5y**, **10y**, **ytd**, and **max**.
```python
Microsoft_share_price_data=Microsoft.history(period="max")
```
With the `Date` as the index the share `Open`, `High`, `Low`, `Close`, `Volume`, and `Stock Splits` are given for each day.
```python
Microsoft_share_price_data.head()
```
Then, I get the following :    
![image1](https://github.com/Atikers/Images/blob/main/Project%20%233%20-%20image(1).jpg)

I can reset the index of the DataFrame with the `reset_index` function.    
I also set the `inplace` paramter to `True` so the change takes place to the DataFrame itself.
```python
Microsoft_share_price_data.reset_index(inplace=True)
```
Then, I get the following :    
![image2](https://github.com/Atikers/Images/blob/main/Project%20%233%20-%20image(2).jpg)

I can plot the `open` price against the `date`:
```python
Microsoft_share_price_data.plot(x="Date", y="Open")
```
Then, I get the following :    
![image3](https://github.com/Atikers/Images/blob/main/Project%20%233%20-%20image(3).jpg)

### 3) Step 3 : Using the yfinance Library to Extract Dividends
Dividends are the distribution of a companys profits to shareholders.    
In this project, they are defined as an amount of money returned per share an investor owns.    
Using the variable dividends I can get a dataframe of the data.    
The period of the data is given by the period defined in the 'history` function.    
```python
Microsoft.dividends
```
Then, I get the following :    
![image4](https://github.com/Atikers/Images/blob/main/Project%20%233%20-%20image(4).jpg)

And I can plot the dividends overtime:    
```python 
Microsoft.dividends.plot()
```
Then, I get the following :    
![image5](https://github.com/Atikers/Images/blob/main/Project%20%233%20-%20image(5).jpg)

### 4) Step 4 : Repeating for NVIDIA
Now using the `Tikcer` module create an object for ***NVIDIA*** with the ticker symbol is ***NVDA*** called; name the object `Nvidia`
```python
Nvidia=yf.Ticker("NVDA")        # For Creating a Ticker object for Nvidia using Yahoo Finance (ticker symbol: NVDA)
```
```python
Nvidia_info=Nvidia.info         # For Retrieving the information dictionary for Nvidia
```
```python
current_directory=os.getcwd()   # For Getting the current working directory
print(f"Current working directory : {current_directory}")        # For Printing the current working directory
```
```python
json_file_path=os.path.join(current_directory, 'Nvidia.json')        # For Creating the full file path for 'Nvidia.json' in the current directory
```
```python
with open(json_file_path, 'w') as json_file:    # For Opening the file 'Nvidia.json' in write mode
    json.dump(Nvidia_info, json_file)           # For Writing the Nvidia information to the JSON file
```
```python
with open(json_file_path) as json_file:         # For Opening 'Nvidia.json' file in read mode
    Nvidia_info_loaded=json.load(json_file)     # For Loading the information from the JSON file into Nvidia_info_loaded
print(Nvidia_info_loaded)
```
```python
Nvidia_share_price_data=Nvidia.history(period="max")        # For Retrieving the historical share price data for Nvidia with the maximum available period
```
```python
Nvidia_share_price_data.head()        # For Displaying the first few rows of the historical share price data for Nvidia
```
Then, I get the following:    
![image6](https://github.com/Atikers/Images/blob/main/Project%20%233%20-%20image(6).jpg)

```python
Nvidia_share_price_data.reset_index(inplace=True)        # For Resetting the index of the share price data to use default integer indexing
```
```python
Nvidia_share_price_data.plot(x="Date", y="Open")        # For Plotting the opening share price over time with Date on the x-axis
```
Then, I get the following:    
![image7](https://github.com/Atikers/Images/blob/main/Project%20%233%20-%20image(7).jpg)
```python
Nvidia.dividends        # For Accessing the dividends data for Nvidia
```
```python
Nvidia.dividends.plot()        # For Plotting the dividends data
```
Then, I get the following:    
![image8](https://github.com/Atikers/Images/blob/main/Project%20%233%20-%20image(8).jpg)


## 4. Conclusion
With the extracted data and visualizations, I can now build an interactive dashboard using Plotly. This dashboard will display key performance indicators, historical share prices, and dividend trends for both ***Microsoft*** and ***Nvidia***. By providing a clear and insightful view of the data, ***StellarInvest*** aims to empower its customers to make well-informed investment decisions.

This project not only demonstrates the power of data science in the financial sector but also highlights how technology can be used to provide valuable insights to investors. As ***StellarInvest*** continues to grow, the dashboard will be expanded to include more stocks and additional financial metrics, helping investors navigate the complex world of stock trading with confidence.

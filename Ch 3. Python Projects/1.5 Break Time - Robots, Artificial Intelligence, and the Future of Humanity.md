# Break Time - Robots, Artificial Intelligence, and the Future of Humanity

**Break Time** section will be dedicated to thinking about various topics to prepare for the future that AI will shape and sharing my thoughts on these matters. While building knowledge about AI is crucial, I believe that imagining and contemplating what the future might hold based on a broad horizon of possibilities is even more important. It would be a lie to say that one can prepare for the future without first imagining and envisioning it!

Moreover, in this section, my primary purpose is to stimulate imagination and motivate, so I will keep the technical details to a minimum, only as much as needed. Letâ€™s imagine the future freely!

For this section, I have organized my thoughts based on the article found at [this link](https://x.com/WankyuChoi/status/1824252312967360805).

Let's think about 100 objects that could be replaced by AI and robots in the short-term, medium-term, and long-term future. Remember that everything in the world is an object. We can start by looking around us, then think about the more distant future. It's good to use convincing movies or novels as a starting point. I'm thinking of ***Blade Runner*** and ***Blade Runner 2049***. But even these aren't that far in the future. 2049 is only about 20 years away. It's important to imagine even further. What about 50 years from now? In 50 years, I'll be 80. Medicine and science will be very advanced, and they might be able to replace all my aged organs, joints, and cells. If our lifespan and body function are extended, we could even think about 100 years from now. 100 years! I'd be 130 then.

I tried to list as many objects as possible that could be replaced. In the end, there were too many to limit to just 100.

**1. Short-term future (within 5 years)**  

Restaurant staff, simple office jobs, translators, weather forecasters, stockbrokers, bank tellers, parking assistants, delivery drivers, simple factory workers, security guards, basic programmers, routine decision-making, basic legal advice, basic medical diagnosis, basic scheduling, mobile phones, regular office computers, some drivers, call center operators.

**2. Medium-term future (within 30 years)**  

Low-value crop farmers, accountants, legal assistants, real estate agents, tour guides, hotel receptionists, fashion designers, graphic designers, ad designers, video editors, composers, journalists, some teachers, chefs, personal assistants, mid-level programmers, financial analysts and strategists, marketing strategists, HR managers, trust, some areas of creativity, emotional support, ethical judgments, complex decision-making, understanding of foreign cultures, private education, expert advice in most fields, all drivers, doctors, lawyers, judges, prosecutors at all levels.

**3. Long-term future (within 100 years)**  

Architects, counselors, scientists, some politicians, CEOs, artists, actors, athletes, firefighters, police officers, soldiers, astronauts, philosophers, policy researchers/makers, environmental activists, love, high-level creativity, intuition, self-awareness, free will, human dignity, cultural/national identity, democracy, human rights, justice, equality, freedom, responsibility, courage, sacrifice, patience, tolerance, compassion... I'll stop here!ðŸ˜‚

The novel ***Prey*** shows scenarios where AI and machines merge with or replace humans. To deepen this discussion, we need to think about questions like "What is a human?", "Where does human value come from?", "What is human dignity?", "What is love?" These are questions humanity has been curious about and seeking answers to since ancient times. Let's continue our thoughts without going too deep.

Considering the flow of capital, productivity improvement, and human instinct for efficiency and pleasure, all the objects we looked at above could be replaced. AI and robots will do much better in almost all areas of human instinct - playing, learning, creating, enjoying, loving, helping, giving and receiving trust, etc. They don't get tired. Their time and energy are unlimited. I'm not talking about catastrophic pessimism. Humans will probably do their best to maintain their dignity while allowing AI and robots to help them live comfortably. However, we need to seriously consider that many people will be replaced by AI and robots in this process. Look at the list above again. There's no area that won't be replaced. Do you think you won't be affected by the AI and robot trend because you're doing well in your field now? The list above is just from my brief thoughts. The order could change, and it could happen very quickly. Remember the exponential function?

Should we resist this possibility of replacement and try to prevent it by protesting with black hoods on, even now?

Think carefully. These are already the scenes depicted in ***Blade Runner*** and ***Blade Runner 2049***. Of course, I don't agree with the gloominess and tragedy, but many people like these movies because they sympathize with the possibility, plausibility, and persuasiveness of the future contained in them.

In other words, it's a (pre)determined future.

The protagonists of both films sincerely loved **replicants** indistinguishable from humans and accepted that there was no difference between humans and replicants. No, replicants are physically and mentally stronger, more sensual, and intellectually superior to humans.

In the end, resisting this huge trend will be meaningless. If we're wise, we should adapt to this trend and ride it. We need to actively understand and accept this trend. To do this, we shouldn't stake our entire life on our current life. Of course, doing our best in our current life is very important. A life that neglects the present to prepare for the future will soon face hardships. However, to prepare for the coming age of AI and robots, we need to imagine the future and make a lot of effort to understand it. We shouldn't just predict the trend of the times. We all need to actively participate, understand, learn, and move forward to bring this trend to our benefit.

If we do that, we won't simply be replaced, but we can live better lives. And finding ways to live better lives is how human civilization has developed so far and the driving force behind positive development. I believe that the more people participate, the more people will enjoy the benefits and be happier.

# Introduction to Relational Databases and Tables

## 1. Relational Databases Concepts
* Most used data model in the world
> Other data models : Hierarchical, Network, Object-Oriented, Document-based, Graph-based    
> **Hierarchical and Network** are not used anymore    
> **Object-Oriented** is used in some applications. E.g. Java    
> **Document-based** is used in some applications. E.g. MongoDB    
> **Graph-based** is used in some applications. E.g. Neo4j    
> **Relational** is the most used data model in the world. Because it is simple and powerful. E.g. MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Oracle, SQL Server    

* Allows for data independence. This means that the data is stored in a way that is independent of the applications that use it.
* Data is stored in tables, with rows and columns.
> Let's think abuout the following concepts:    
> Logical Data Independence - The ability to change the logical schema without changing the application    
> Physical Data Independence - The ability to change the physical schema without changing the application    
> Physical Storage Independence - The ability to change the physical storage without changing the application    

### 1) Entity-Relationship Model
* Used as a tool to design the relational databases
* Entities : Objects or concepts that we want to store data about.
* Attributes : Characteristics of the entities.
* E.g. **Book** entity with attributes **title**, **author**, **year**, **isbn**, **publisher**, **pages**, **price**.
    
### 2) Mapping Entity Diagrams to Tables
* Entites become tables
* Attributes become columns
* E.g. Named **Book** table with columns **title**, **author**, **year**, **isbn**, **publisher**, **pages**, **price**.
    * What is **Char**? It is a data type that stores a fixed-length string. E.g. **Char(50)** stores a string with a maximum length of 50 characters.

# Analyzing Stock Performance and Building a Dashboard
## 1) Scenario
I am working for a new startup investment firm that helps customers invest their money in stocks.  
My job is to extract financial data like historical share price and quarterly revenue reportings from various sources using Python libraries and webscraping on popular stocks.  
After collecting this data I will visualize it in a dashboard to identify patterns or trends. The stocks I will work with are ***Apple, NVIDIA***.

>**Dashboard Analytics Displayed**
>
>A dashboard often provides a view of key performance indicators in a clear way.  
>Analyzing a data set and extracting key performance indicators will be practiced.  
>Prompts will be used to support learning in accessing and displaying data in dashboards.  
>Learning how to display key performance indicators on a dashboard will be included in this project.  
>I will be using Plotly in this project for data visualization.  

>**About Stock Shares**
>
>A company's stock share is a piece of the company; more precisely:    
>
>A stock (=equity) is a security that represents the ownership of a fraction of a corporation.    
>This entitles the owner of the stock to a proportion of the corporation's assets and profits equal to how much stock they own. 
>Units of stock are called **shares.**
>
>An investor can buy a stock and sell it later. 
>If the stock price increases, the investor profits, If it decreases, the investor with incur a loss. 
>Determining the stock price is complex; it depends on the number of outstanding shares, the size of the company's future profits, and much more. 
>People trade stocks throughout the day. The **stock ticker** is a report of the price of a certain stock, updated continuously throughout the trading session by the >various stock market exchanges. 
>In this lab, I will use the `y-finance API` to obtain the stock ticker and extract information about the stock. 

## 2) Setup

```python
!pip install yfinance
!pip install pandas
!pip install matplotlib
```
```python
import yfinance as yf            # Importing the yfinance library for financial data
import pandas as pd              # Importing the pandas library for data manipulation
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  # Importing the matplotlib library for plotting
import os                        # Importing the os library for operating system interactions
import json                      # Importing the json library for JSON file handling
```
```python
%matplotlib inline               # Enable inline plotting for Jupyter notebooks
```

## 3) Steps
### (1) Step 1 : Using the yfinance Library to Extract Stock Data
Using the `Ticker` module I can create an object that will allow me to access functions to extract data.    
To do this I need to provide the ticker symbol for the stock, here the company is ***Apple*** and the ticker symbol is ***AAPL***.    

```python
Apple=yf.Ticker("AAPL")   # Creating a Ticker object for Apple using Yahoo Finance (ticker symbol: AAPL)
```
```python
Apple_info=Apple.info     # Retrieving the information dictionary for Apple
```

Then, I can access funcitons and variables to extract the type of data I need. I can view them and what they represent here : ***https://aroussi.com/post/python-yahoo-finance***

```python
current_directory=os.getcwd()
print(f"Current working directory : {current_directory}")
```
```python
json_file_path=os.path.join(current_directory, 'Apple.json')
```
```python
with open(json_file_path, 'w') as json_file:
    json.dump(Apple_info, json_file)
```

**Stock Info**
Using the attribute `info` I can extract information about the stock as a python dictionary.
```python
with open(json_file_path) as json_file:
    Apple_info_loaded=json.load(json_file)
print(Apple_info_loaded)
```

### (2) Step 2 : Extracting Share Price
A share is the single smallest part of a company's stock that I can buy, the prices of these shares fluctuate over time.    
Using the `history` method I can get the share price of the stock over a certain period of time.    
Using the `period` parameter I can set how far back from the present to get data.    
The options for `period` are 1 day as **1d**, **5d**, 1 month **1mo**, **3mo**, **6mo**, 1 year **1y**, **2y**, **5y**, **10y**, **ytd**, and **max**.
```python
Apple_share_price_data=Apple.history(period="max")
```
With the `Date` as the index the share `Open`, `High`, `Low`, `Close`, `Volume`, and `Stock Splits` are given for each day.
```python
Apple_share_price_data.head()
```
I can reset the index of the DataFrame with the `reset_index` function.    
I also set the `inplace` paramter to `True` so the change takes place to the DataFrame itself.
```python
Apple_share_price_data.reset_index(inplace=True)
```
Then, I get the following :    
![table0](https://github.com/Atikers/Images/blob/main/Project%20%233%20-%20image(0).jpg)

I can plot the `open` price against the `date`:
```python
Apple_share_price_data.plot(x="Date", y="Open")
```
Then, I get the following :    
![graph1](https://github.com/Atikers/Images/blob/main/Project%20%233%20-%20image(1).jpg)

### (3) Step 3 : Extracting Dividends
Dividends are the distribution of a companys profits to shareholders.    
In this project, they are defined as an amount of money returned per share an investor owns.    
Using the variable dividends I can get a dataframe of the data.    
The period of the data is given by the period defined in the 'history` function.    
```python
Apple.dividends
```
Then, I get the following :    
![table1](https://github.com/Atikers/Images/blob/main/Project%20%233%20-%20image(2).jpg)

And I can plot the dividends overtime:    
```python 
Apple.dividends.plot()
```
Then, I get the following :    
![graph2](https://github.com/Atikers/Images/blob/main/Project%20%233%20-%20image(3).jpg)

### (4) Stpe 4 : NVIDIA
Now using the `Tikcer` module create an object for ***NVIDIA*** with the ticker symbol is ***NVDA*** called; name the object `Nvidia`
```python
Nvidia=yf.Ticker("NVDA")        # Creating a Ticker object for Nvidia using Yahoo Finance (ticker symbol: NVDA)
```
```python
Nvidia_info=Nvidia.info         # Retrieving the information dictionary for Nvidia
```
```python
current_directory=os.getcwd()   # Getting the current working directory
print(f"Current working directory : {current_directory}")        # Printing the current working directory
```
```python
json_file_path=os.path.join(current_directory, 'Nvidia.json')        # Creating the full file path for 'Nvidia.json' in the current directory
```
```python
with open(json_file_path, 'w') as json_file:    # Opening the file 'Nvidia.json' in write mode
    json.dump(Nvidia_info, json_file)           # Writing the Nvidia information to the JSON file
```
```python
with open(json_file_path) as json_file:         # Opening 'Nvidia.json' file in read mode
    Nvidia_info_loaded=json.load(json_file)     # Loading the information from the JSON file into Nvidia_info_loaded
print(Nvidia_info_loaded)
```
```python
Nvidia_share_price_data=Nvidia.history(period="max")        # Retrieving the historical share price data for Nvidia with the maximum available period
```
```python
Nvidia_share_price_data.head()        # Displaying the first few rows of the historical share price data for Nvidia
```
Then, I get the following:    
![table2](https://github.com/Atikers/Images/blob/main/Project%20%233%20-%20image(4).jpg)

```python
Nvidia_share_price_data.reset_index(inplace=True)        # Resetting the index of the share price data to use default integer indexing
```
```python
Nvidia_share_price_data.plot(x="Date", y="Open")        # Plotting the opening share price over time with Date on the x-axis
```
Then, I get the following:    
![graph3](https://github.com/Atikers/Images/blob/main/Project%20%233%20-%20image(5).jpg)
```python
Nvidia.dividends        # Accessing the dividends data for Nvidia
```
```python
Nvidia.dividends.plot()        # Plotting the dividends data
```
Then, I get the following:    
![graph4](https://github.com/Atikers/Images/blob/main/Project%20%233%20-%20image(6).jpg)

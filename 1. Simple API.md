# Extracting and Processing GDP Data
## 1) Scenario
An international bank, ***Silverman Sachs***, looking to expand its business in different countries across the world, has recruited me. I have been hired as a Data Scientist and am tasked with creating a script that can extract the list of the top 10 largest economies in the world in descending order of their GDPs in **Billion USD** (rounded to 2 decimal places), as reported by ***The International Monetary Fund (IMF)***.

The required data can be found at the following URL :

## 2) Setup
For this task, I will be using the following libraries:
* `Pandas` for managing the data.
* `Numpy` for mathematical operations.
> **Pandas : The Data Organizer**  
> Imagine you are managing a large office with many employees, departments, and tasks. You have a lot of information to keep track of: employee details, project statuses, financial records, etc. Doing this manually with pen and paper would be incredibly **time-consuming and prone to errors**. Time is the most important resource.
>
> Now, picture Pandas as a highly efficient digital filing system. This system allows you to:
>
> 1. Organizing Data: Just like filing cabinets and folders, Pandas helps you arrange data in a structured way. It uses data frames (like tables in Excel) where you can store, organize, and access information quickly.
> 2. Manipulating Data: Imagine being able to quickly sort files, find specific information, update records, and generate reports with just a few clicks. Pandas provides functions to filter, sort, merge, and transform data effortlessly.
> 3. Analyzing Data: Think of having a smart assistant who can quickly summarize data, generate insights, and provide you with statistics. Pandas can perform complex data analysis tasks, helping you make informed decisions based on your data.
> 
> In essence, Pandas is your go-to tool for managing and analyzing large sets of data efficiently, much like a digital filing system and smart assistant combined.

> **Numpy : The Math Whiz**  
> Now, let's think about Numpy in the context of a construction project. When you're building something, you need precise measurements, calculations, and the ability to handle various materials and dimensions accurately.
> 1. Handling Numbers: Numpy is like a top-notch calculator that can handle large arrays of numbers efficiently. It can perform operations on these numbers at lightning speed, much faster than using traditional methods.
> 2. Precision and Performance: Imagine having a skilled engineer who can quickly compute the exact amount of materials needed, the structural integrity of designs, and other complex mathematical problems. Numpy offers high precision and performance, making it ideal for scientific computations and numerical analysis.
> 3. Complex Calculations: Just as an engineer can solve complex equations and design intricate structures, Numpy can handle advanced mathematical functions, linear algebra, statistical operations, and more. It's designed to perform these tasks efficiently and accurately.
> 
> In essence, Numpy is like having a powerful calculator and an expert engineer by your side, enabling you to perform and manage complex numerical tasks with ease.

Importing Required Libraries:
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
```


## 3) Steps
### (1) Step 1 : Extracting GDP data using ***Web Scraping***
```python
URL='https://web.archive.org/web/20230902185326/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28nominal%29'

tables=pd.read_html(URL)                     # For Extracting tables from the webpage using pandas.
df=tables[3]                                 # For Retaining table number 3 as the required dataframe.
df.columns=range(df.shape[1])                # For Replacing the column headers with column numbers
df=df[[0,2]]                                 # For Retaining columns with index 0 and 2 (name of country and value of GDP)
df=df.iloc[1:11,:]                           # For Retaining the Rows with index 1 to 10, indicationg the top 10 economies of the world.
df.columns=['Country', 'GDP (Million USD)']  # For Assigning column names as "Country" and "GDP (Million USD)"
```
The following is **table number 3** from the URL :

![GDP table from the URL](https://github.com/Atikers/Images/blob/main/Project%20%231%20-%20image%20(1).jpg)


### (2) Step 2 : Modifying the GDP Column
```python
df['GDP(Million USD)']=df['GDP(Million USD)'].astype(int)        # For Changing the data type of the 'GDP(Million USD)' column to integer. Using astype() method
df[['GDP(Million USD']]=df[['GDP(Million USD)']]/1000            # For Converting the GDP value in Million USD to Billion USD
df[['GDP(Million USD)']]=np.round(df[['GDP(Million USD)']], 2)   # For Using numpy.round() method to round the value to 2 decimal places.
df.rename(Columns={'GDP(Million USD)':'GDP(Billion USD)'})       # For Renaming the column header from 'GDP (Million USD)' to 'GDP(Billion USD)'
```
Then, I get the following :

![GDP table](https://github.com/Atikers/images/blob/main/Project%20%231%20-%20image%20(2).jpg)


### (3) Step 3 : Saving the DataFrame to CSV
```python
df.to_csv('./Largest_Economies.csv')          # For Saving the DataFrame to a CSV file named "Largest_Economies.csv"
```

## 4) Conclusion
In this project, I extracted and processed data from a web page using Python.  

I covered web scraping with `pandas.read_html()`, data manipulation with `Pandas`, and numerical operations with `Numpy`.  
This script is a basic but powerful example of how Python can be used for data science tasks.

By following these steps, I successfully created a script that extracts the list of the top 10 largest economies by GDP, processes the data, and saves it to a CSV file. This is just one of the many ways Python can be utilized in the field of data science.

With this knowledge, I can now explore more complex data extraction and processing tasks, leveraging the power of Python and its extensive libraries.

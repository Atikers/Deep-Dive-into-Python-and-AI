# Probability: The Object-Oriented Explorer's Guide

## What Is Probability?

> **Have you ever wondered why some AI systems seem almost magical in their ability to predict outcomes? How does your phone know which app you'll open next, or how does Netflix guess what you'll want to watch?**

Behind these predictions lies a powerful concept: probability!

### Probability as an Object System

Imagine probability as a universe of objects with properties and behaviors - just like in the real world. In this universe:

- **The Universe Object (Sample Space)** contains all possible outcomes
- **Event Objects** are collections of specific outcomes we're interested in
- **Probability Values** measure how likely these events are to occur

Let's see this object system in action with a simple example:

Imagine a classroom with 10 students, where 3 play soccer and 7 don't. If you randomly select a student:

Think of this as creating a "Classroom Object" with properties like totalStudents (10), soccerPlayers (3), and nonPlayers (7). This object would have a method called "probabilityOfSoccerPlayer" that divides soccerPlayers by totalStudents, giving us 0.3 or 30%.

This object-oriented view helps us understand that:  

$$
P(\text{soccer}) = \frac{\text{Number of soccer-playing students}}{\text{Total number of students}} = \frac{3}{10} = 0.3
$$

What's powerful about thinking of probability in terms of objects is that we can apply the same structure to any random situation!

### Inheritance in Probability Systems

All probability systems inherit from a base "Random Experiment" class with these core properties:

Think of a base "Random Experiment" object that contains a collection of all possible outcomes (the sample space) and named collections of specific outcomes we care about (events). This base object would have a method to calculate probability by dividing the event size by the sample space size.

Different probability scenarios simply extend this base class:

- **CoinFlip** inherits from RandomExperiment
- **DiceRoll** inherits from RandomExperiment  
- **StudentSelection** inherits from RandomExperiment

This inheritance pattern reveals a profound truth: despite surface differences, all random processes share the same fundamental structure!

### Polymorphism: Same Method, Different Implementations

The beauty of probability through an object-oriented lens is that different random experiments can implement the same interface in their own unique ways:

For example, a "CoinFlip" object might have a sample space of just "Heads" and "Tails" and implement probability calculation in a straightforward way - dividing the number of ways to get the desired outcome by the total number of possible outcomes.

In contrast, a "WeightedDie" object would have the same interface but with different implementation. Its sample space would contain the numbers 1 through 6, but each number would have a different weight (like 0.1 for 1 and 2, and 0.2 for 3 through 6). When calculating probability, it would sum the weights of the desired outcomes rather than simply counting them.

This polymorphism explains why AI systems can handle such diverse probability scenarios - from language prediction to image recognition - using the same fundamental approach!

### Coin Flip Experiments: Building Complexity

Let's explore how we can create increasingly complex probability objects by combining simpler ones.

#### The Single Coin Object

Think of a "SingleCoin" object with a property listing its possible outcomes ("H" and "T") and two methods: one to flip the coin (randomly choosing H or T) and another to calculate the probability of a specific outcome (always 1/2 for a fair coin).

When you flip a fair coin:  

$$
P(\text{Heads}) = \frac{1}{2}, \quad P(\text{Tails}) = \frac{1}{2}
$$

#### The Two Coin Object

What happens when we combine two coin objects? We get a new object with more complex behavior:

Imagine a "TwoCoins" object that contains two separate coin objects inside it. This composite object would have a method to flip both coins at once, returning their combined results. Its sample space would expand to four possibilities ("HH", "HT", "TH", "TT"), and the probability of any specific outcome would be 1/4 if all outcomes are equally likely.

For two coins, our sample space expands to 4 possibilities, with:  

$$
P(\text{HH}) = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25
$$

#### The Three Coin Object

Extending to three coins creates even more complex behavior:

A "ThreeCoins" object would contain three separate coin objects. It would have a method to flip all three at once, returning their combined results. The sample space expands to eight possibilities ("HHH", "HHT", "HTH", "THH", "HTT", "THT", "TTH", "TTT"), with each specific outcome having a probability of 1/8.

With three coins:  

$$
P(\text{HHH}) = \frac{1}{8} = 0.125
$$

Notice how we're encapsulating complexity! The user of a ThreeCoins object doesn't need to understand all the internal workings - they just need to know how to use the interface.

### Encapsulation: Hiding Complexity in AI Systems

AI systems use probability in incredibly complex ways, but encapsulation allows them to hide this complexity behind simple interfaces:

For instance, a "SpamFilter" object would contain complex internal probability models (like Bayesian networks and word probability maps) but present a simple public interface - perhaps just a method called "checkEmail" that takes an email as input and returns "Spam" or "Not Spam" as output. Inside this method, complex probability calculations happen, but users don't need to understand them.

When you use Gmail's spam filter, you don't need to understand the complex probability calculations happening behind the scenes - that complexity is encapsulated away!

### Why This Object-Oriented View Matters for AI

Modern AI systems are essentially massive probability calculators built on object-oriented principles:

- **Neural Networks** inherit from base probability models
- **Different AI Systems** implement the same probability interfaces in different ways (polymorphism)
- **Complex Systems** are built by combining simpler probability objects
- **User-Friendly AI** encapsulates complex probability calculations behind simple interfaces

By understanding probability through this object-oriented lens, you're not just learning math - you're learning how AI systems actually think!

### Wrap-Up and Looking Ahead

You've now seen how probability can be viewed as an elegant system of objects with properties and behaviors. This perspective will serve you well as we dive deeper into AI concepts.

**Coming Next:**
- How probabilities combine and interact (probability rules)
- How new information updates our probabilities (Bayes' theorem)
- How we model real-world data with probability distributions

Remember: The most powerful AI systems in the world are built on these fundamental probability objects. Learn them, and you'll understand the building blocks of artificial intelligence!

## What Happens When Events *Don't* Occur?

> **Have you ever wondered how AI systems make decisions when faced with uncertainty? For instance, how does a weather app decide whether to display "No rain today" instead of "Rainy"? The answer lies in understanding not just what happens, but what *doesn't* happen!**

### The Complement: The "Not Happening" Side of Probability

In our object-oriented framework of probability, every Event object has a natural counterpart - its complement. If we think of an Event as a collection of specific outcomes we're interested in, then its complement is simply everything else in our universe of possibilities.

Let's visualize this relationship:

- **Event Object**: The specific outcomes we're tracking
- **Complement Object**: All other outcomes in our sample space
- **Together**: They cover the entire universe of possibilities (100%)

This creates a fundamental property: an outcome must either belong to our Event or to its Complement - it cannot be in both or neither. This relationship gives us a powerful shortcut for calculating probabilities!

### The Classroom Example Revisited

Remember our Classroom object with 10 students, where 3 play soccer? Let's now look at its complement property:

If we think of our Classroom object, it has these properties:
- totalStudents: 10
- soccerPlayers: 3
- nonSoccerPlayers: 7

The probability of selecting a soccer player was 0.3 or 30%. But what's the probability of selecting a student who doesn't play soccer?

We could calculate this directly:  

$$
P(\text{not soccer}) = \frac{\text{Number of non-soccer-playing students}}{\text{Total number of students}} = \frac{7}{10} = 0.7
$$

But notice something interesting: $0.3 + 0.7 = 1$. This isn't a coincidence!

### The Complement Rule: A Powerful Property

The Complement Rule states: The probability of an event NOT occurring equals 1 minus the probability of it occurring.

In our object-oriented terms:
- For any Event object, if we know its probability value...
- We can instantly know its Complement's probability by subtracting from 1

Mathematically:  

$$
P(\text{not A}) = 1 - P(\text{A})
$$

Or using mathematical notation:  

$$
P(A') = 1 - P(A)
$$

Where $A'$ represents the complement of event $A$.

### Visualizing with the Universe Object

Think of our Universe (Sample Space) object as a container divided into two sections:
- One section is our Event
- The other section is everything else (the Complement)

If our Event takes up 30% of the Universe, then its Complement must take up the remaining 70%. Together, they always equal 100% of our Universe object.

This division is perfect and complete - every possible outcome must belong to either our Event or its Complement, never both, never neither. This is why they always sum to 1 (or 100%).

### Practical Applications: When Not Happening Is Easier to Calculate

The Complement Rule becomes particularly valuable when:
1. The original event has many outcomes to count
2. The complement has fewer outcomes to count
3. The original event's probability is already known

Let's see this in action with our coin examples:

### The Three Coins Example: A Shortcut Method

Remember our ThreeCoins object with its eight possible outcomes? What's the probability of NOT getting three heads?

Using the Complement Rule:  

$$
P(\text{not three heads}) = 1 - P(\text{three heads}) = 1 - \frac{1}{8} = \frac{7}{8}
$$

Notice how efficient this is! Instead of counting seven different outcomes (HHT, HTH, THH, HTT, THT, TTH, TTT), we simply used what we already knew about the probability of three heads.

### The Die Example: Applying the Same Principle

For a single die, what's the probability of rolling anything OTHER than a 6?

Using the Complement Rule:  

$$
P(\text{not 6}) = 1 - P(\text{6}) = 1 - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{5}{6}
$$

Again, this approach saves us counting individual outcomes when we can use what we already know.

### Why This Matters for AI: Making Decisions Under Uncertainty

AI systems constantly work with complements when making decisions:

- A spam filter decides if an email is "spam" or "not spam"
- A medical AI determines if an image shows "disease" or "no disease"
- A recommendation system decides if you will "like" or "not like" a movie

The Complement Rule allows AI systems to make these decisions more efficiently. Often, it's easier to calculate the probability of one outcome and then derive its complement rather than calculating both separately.

### The Object-Oriented Perspective: Encapsulating the Complement

In our object-oriented approach, we can think of every Event object as automatically having a built-in complement method:

Think of a RandomEvent object that has a "calculateComplement()" method that simply returns 1 minus the event's own probability. This elegantly encapsulates the relationship between an event and its complement.

This is why AI systems don't need separate calculations for complementary outcomes - the relationship is built into their probability objects.

### Looking Ahead: Building on Complements

The Complement Rule is one of the fundamental building blocks for more complex probability concepts we'll explore:

- How to calculate probabilities when events can happen together (intersection)
- How to calculate probabilities when either of multiple events can happen (union)
- How new information changes our probability assessments (conditional probability)

Each of these concepts builds on our understanding of events and their complements, making this principle essential to master.

Remember: In the world of probability objects, every event comes with its shadow - the complement - and together they always complete the universe of possibilities!

## When Can We Simply Add Probabilities?

> **Have you ever wondered how AI systems calculate the chances of multiple possible outcomes?**

For instance, how does a voice assistant determine whether you're asking for weather OR news? The answer lies in understanding how probabilities combine!

### The Addition Principle: Combining Event Objects

In our object-oriented probability universe, we often want to know the likelihood of "this OR that" happening. This is where the Addition Principle comes in - a powerful method for combining Event objects.

Think of the Addition Principle as a special method that operates on Event objects:

```
Universe {
   combineDisjointEvents(eventA, eventB) {
      return eventA.probability + eventB.probability;
   }
}
```

But there's an important condition: this simple addition only works when the events are **disjoint** - meaning they cannot happen simultaneously. Let's explore what this means through examples.

### Disjoint Events: When Objects Cannot Overlap

Two Event objects are disjoint (or mutually exclusive) when they cannot occur at the same time - they have no outcomes in common.

Imagine a school where each student can play only one sport. In this school:
- 30% of students play soccer (probability 0.3)
- 40% of students play basketball (probability 0.4)

What's the probability that a randomly selected student plays either soccer OR basketball?

Since no student plays both sports (the events are disjoint), we can simply add:  

$$
P(\text{soccer OR basketball}) = P(\text{soccer}) + P(\text{basketball}) = 0.3 + 0.4 = 0.7
$$

This makes intuitive sense: if 30% play soccer and 40% play basketball, then 70% play one of these sports.

### Visualizing with the Union Operation

In object-oriented terms, we can think of this as applying a "union" operation to our Event objects. The union - symbolized as $\cup$ - represents all outcomes in either event.

For disjoint events, the probability of the union equals the sum of the individual probabilities:  

$$
P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)
$$

This is like creating a new composite Event object that contains all the outcomes from both original events.

### Dice Examples: Applying the Addition Principle

Let's apply this to our DiceRoll object:

#### Example 1: Even Number OR Five
When rolling a six-sided die, what's the probability of getting an even number OR a five?

First, let's identify our events:
- Event A: Rolling an even number (2, 4, 6) - probability $\frac{3}{6} = 0.5$
- Event B: Rolling a five (5) - probability $\frac{1}{6}$

Are these events disjoint? Yes! No number is both even AND equal to five.

Therefore:  

$$
P(\text{even OR five}) = P(\text{even}) + P(\text{five}) = \frac{3}{6} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{4}{6}
$$

#### Example 2: Sum of Seven OR Sum of Ten
When rolling two dice, what's the probability of getting a sum of seven OR a sum of ten?

Let's identify our events:
- Event A: Sum equals 7 - occurs in 6 out of 36 possible outcomes - probability $\frac{6}{36}$
- Event B: Sum equals 10 - occurs in 3 out of 36 possible outcomes - probability $\frac{3}{36}$

Are these events disjoint? Yes! The sum cannot be both 7 and 10 simultaneously.

Therefore:  

$$
P(\text{sum of 7 OR sum of 10}) = P(\text{sum of 7}) + P(\text{sum of 10}) = \frac{6}{36} + \frac{3}{36} = \frac{9}{36}
$$

#### Example 3: Difference of Two OR Difference of One
When rolling two dice, what's the probability of getting a difference of two OR a difference of one?

Let's identify our events:
- Event A: Difference equals 2 - occurs in 8 out of 36 possible outcomes - probability $\frac{8}{36}$
- Event B: Difference equals 1 - occurs in 10 out of 36 possible outcomes - probability $\frac{10}{36}$

Are these events disjoint? Yes! The difference cannot be both 2 and 1 simultaneously.

Therefore:  

$$
P(\text{difference of 2 OR difference of 1}) = P(\text{difference of 2}) + P(\text{difference of 1}) = \frac{8}{36} + \frac{10}{36} = \frac{18}{36}
$$

### The Object-Oriented Perspective: Event Combiners

From an object-oriented viewpoint, we can think of the Addition Principle as a special method that combines Event objects in a specific way:

When we have a ProbabilityUniverse object, it might have different methods for combining events:
- `combineDisjointEvents(eventA, eventB)` - adds probabilities for disjoint events
- `combineOverlappingEvents(eventA, eventB, overlapProbability)` - handles events that can occur together (which we'll explore in a next section)

This approach allows us to encapsulate the rules for combining probabilities into clean, reusable methods that handle the complexity for us.

### Why This Matters for AI

AI systems constantly need to calculate the probability of compound events. For example:
- A voice assistant determining if you're asking about weather OR news
- A recommendation system calculating if you'll like movie A OR movie B
- A medical diagnosis system assessing if symptom X OR symptom Y indicates a particular condition

By understanding when events are disjoint and how to combine their probabilities, AI systems can make accurate predictions about complex scenarios.

### Looking Ahead: When Events Overlap

We've focused on disjoint events in this lesson, but what happens when events can occur simultaneously? For instance, what if students could play both soccer AND basketball?

In our next exploration, we'll discover how to handle overlapping events using the more general Addition Rule:  

$$
P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)
$$

This formula accounts for the overlap between events, ensuring we don't count shared outcomes twice.

### Key Takeaways

- The Addition Principle allows us to find the probability of "either/or" scenarios
- For disjoint (mutually exclusive) events, we can simply add their probabilities
- This principle works because disjoint events have no outcomes in common
- The object-oriented approach helps us encapsulate these rules into reusable methods
- Understanding this principle is crucial for AI systems that need to evaluate multiple possibilities

Remember: Whenever you encounter an "OR" situation with events that cannot happen simultaneously, the Addition Principle gives you a straightforward way to calculate the combined probability!

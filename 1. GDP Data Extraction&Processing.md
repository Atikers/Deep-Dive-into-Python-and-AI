# 1. GDP Data Extraction and processing
## 1) Scenario
An international bank ***Siverman Sachs*** that is looking to expand its business in different countries across the world has recruited me. I have been hired as a Data Scientist and am tasked with creating a script that can extract the list of the top 10 largest economies of the world in descending order of their GDPs in ***Billion USD*** (rounded to 2 decimal places), as logged by ***the International Monetary Fund (IMF)***.

The required data is on the URL :

URL=https://web.archive.org/web/20230902185326/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28nominal%29

## 2) Setup
For this practice, I will be using the following libraries:
* `Pandas` for managing the data.
* `Numpy` for mathematical operations.

Importing Required Libraries:
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
```

## 3) Exercises
### (1) Exercise 1 : Extracting GDP data using ***Web Scraping***
```python
URL='https://web.archive.org/web/20230902185326/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28nominal%29'

tables=pd.read_html(URL)                     # Extracting tables from webpage using pandas.
df=tables[3]                                 # Retaining table number 3 as the required dataframe.
df.columns=range(df.shape[1])                # Replacing the column headers with column numbers
df=df[[0,2]]                                 # Retaining columns with index 0 and 2 (name of country and value of GDP)
df=df.iloc[1:11,:]                           # Retaining the Rows with index 1 to 10, indicationg the top 10 economies of the world.
df.columns=['Country', 'GDP (Million USD)']  # Assigning column names as "Country" and "GDP (Million USD)"
```
Table number 3 on the URL is below :
![GDP table on the URL](https://github.com/Atikers/imoge/blob/main/practice%20GDP%20(2).jpg)

### (2) Exercise 2 : Modifying the GDP Column
```python
df['GDP(Million USD)']=df['GDP(Million USD)'].astype(int)        # Changing the data type of the 'GDP(Million USD)' column to integer. Using astype() method
df[['GDP(Million USD']]=df[['GDP(Million USD)']]/1000            # Converting the GDP value in Million USD to Billion USD
df[['GDP(Million USD)']]=np.round(df[['GDP(Million USD)']], 2)   # Using numpy.round() method to round the value to 2 decimal places.
df.rename(Columns={'GDP(Million USD)':'GDP(Billion USD)'})       # Renaming the column header from 'GDP (Million USD)' to 'GDP(Billion USD)'
```
The table I can get is below :

![GDP table](https://github.com/Atikers/imoge/blob/main/practice%20GDP%20(1).jpg)

### (3) Exercise 3 : Saving the DataFrame to CSV
```python
df.to_csv('./Largest_Economies.csv')          # Saving the DataFrame to a CSV file named "Largest_Economies.csv"

## 1) Project Scenario
An international bank ***Siverman Sachs*** that is looking to expand its business in different countries across the world has recruited you. You have been hired as a Data Engineer and are tasked with creating a script that can extract the list of the top 10 largest economies of the world in descending order of their GDPs in ***Billion USD*** (rounded to 2 decimal places), as logged by the International Monetary Fund (***IMF***).

The required data is on the URL mentioned below:

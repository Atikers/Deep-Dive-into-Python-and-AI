# Monty Hall Problem

We’ll explore the classic Monty Hall problem using an **object-oriented** framework and **simulation** to grasp the concept of conditional probability. We extend to a **generalized (n, k) case**, a scenario where the host might not know where the car is, and we compare **multiple strategies**. We’ll also briefly touch on **Bayesian reasoning**, provide a **CLI version** for those not using Jupyter, and show a **heatmap** visualization for different parameters.

## A Bit of Historical Background

The Monty Hall problem originates from the American TV game show “Let’s Make a Deal,” hosted by **Monty Hall**. In the 1990s, **Marilyn vos Savant**, then renowned for having the “highest recorded IQ,” presented this puzzle in her magazine column. Despite the relatively simple setup, countless readers—including professional mathematicians and scientists—debated the result. Most initially believed switching makes no difference (they thought the probability would be 1/2), but Marilyn vos Savant insisted it was 2/3 for switching. After much controversy, she was proven correct, solidifying this puzzle as a classic example of **counterintuitive conditional probability**.

## Problem Restatement (Classic Monty Hall)

In the original version, there are 3 doors:

1. Behind exactly one door is a **car** (the prized reward).
2. Behind the other two doors are **goats** (the losing outcome).
3. The player picks one door (but doesn’t open it yet).
4. The host (knowing what’s behind each door) opens one of the **other** two doors, always revealing **a goat**.
5. The host then offers: “Do you want to **switch** to the remaining unopened door, or **stay** with your original choice?”

**Key Question**: Which is better—switching or staying?

Mathematically, switching yields a winning probability of **2/3**, and staying yields only **1/3**. But because this is so counterintuitive, many people (even experts) assume it’s 1/2. That’s why it’s such a famous paradox in conditional probability.

## Bayesian Perspective (Brief)

A quick rundown on how we arrive at **2/3** by conditional probability:

- **Initial choice**: When you first select a door, you have a 1/3 probability of choosing the car and a 2/3 probability of choosing a goat.
- **Host's action**: The host (who knows where the car is) deliberately opens one of the doors you didn't choose, always revealing a goat.
- **The key insight**: The host's action provides you with new information, but it affects the two scenarios differently:
- If you initially chose a goat (2/3 probability): The host must reveal the other goat, meaning the remaining unopened door must contain the car. Switching gives you a 100% chance of getting the car.
- If you initially chose the car (1/3 probability): The host reveals one of the two goats, and switching guarantees you'll get the remaining goat. Switching gives you a 0% chance of getting the car.
- **Overall probability when switching**: 
   - (2/3 × 100%) + (1/3 × 0%) = 2/3
- **Staying with your original choice**: Your initial 1/3 probability never changes, as no new information affects your original selection.

This unintuitive result demonstrates why conditional probability can sometimes contradict our initial instincts about randomness and chance.

Formally, you can frame it with Bayes’ Theorem, but the above intuitive explanation is often enough for new learners—plus we can confirm it via simulation.

## Object-Oriented Design

We’ll use two classes:

1. **`Door`**: Encapsulates whether it contains a prize (car) and whether it’s open.  
2. **`MontyHallGame`**: Manages the doors, the player’s choice, and the host’s actions.

### Door Class

```python
class Door:
    def __init__(self, has_prize=False):
        self.has_prize = has_prize
        self.is_open = False
    
    def open(self):
        self.is_open = True
        
    def get_state(self):
        if self.is_open:
            return "Open - " + ("Prize" if self.has_prize else "Goat")
        else:
            return "Closed"
```

- `has_prize`: Boolean indicating if this door has the car.  
- `is_open`: Whether the door is currently opened.  

### MontyHallGame Class

```python
import numpy as np

class MontyHallGame:
    def __init__(self, num_doors=3):
        # Initialize door objects
        self.doors = [Door() for _ in range(num_doors)]
        
        # Randomly place a prize behind one door
        prize_door = np.random.randint(0, num_doors)
        self.doors[prize_door].has_prize = True
        
        # Tracking
        self.initial_choice = None
        self.opened_door = None
        self.final_choice = None
    
    def choose_door(self, door_index):
        self.initial_choice = door_index
    
    def host_opens_door(self):
        # Host must open a door that the player didn't choose and that doesn't have the car
        candidates = [
            i for i in range(len(self.doors))
            if i != self.initial_choice and not self.doors[i].has_prize
        ]
        self.opened_door = np.random.choice(candidates)
        self.doors[self.opened_door].open()
    
    def switch_doors(self):
        # Switch to the remaining unopened door
        candidates = [
            i for i in range(len(self.doors))
            if i != self.initial_choice and i != self.opened_door
        ]
        self.final_choice = candidates[0]  # There's exactly one in the classic 3-door scenario.
        
    def stay_with_choice(self):
        self.final_choice = self.initial_choice
    
    def get_result(self):
        return self.doors[self.final_choice].has_prize
```

## Classic Monty Hall Simulation (Compact Version)

If you just want a quick simulation, you don’t have to create classes. Here’s a straightforward approach:

```python
def monty_hall(switch=True):
    """
    Conducts a single play of the 3-door Monty Hall problem.
    Returns 1 if the player wins the car, otherwise 0.
    """
    # Initialize doors
    doors = np.array([0, 0, 0])  # 0 = goat, 1 = car
    prize_idx = np.random.randint(0, 3)
    doors[prize_idx] = 1
    
    # Player chooses a door
    choice = np.random.randint(0, 3)
    
    # Host opens one goat door (not chosen by the player, and not the car)
    open_candidates = [i for i in range(3) if i != choice and i != prize_idx]
    opened = np.random.choice(open_candidates)
    
    # If switching, pick the remaining door
    if switch:
        choice = [i for i in range(3) if i not in (choice, opened)][0]
    
    return doors[choice]

def run_simulations(num_simulations=10000):
    switch_win = 0
    stay_win = 0
    
    for _ in range(num_simulations):
        switch_win += monty_hall(switch=True)
        stay_win += monty_hall(switch=False)
    
    switch_rate = switch_win / num_simulations * 100
    stay_rate = stay_win / num_simulations * 100
    
    return switch_rate, stay_rate

# Test with various simulation sizes
for t in [10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000]:
    sw, st = run_simulations(t)
    print(f"[{t} trials] Switch win rate: {sw:.2f}%, Stay win rate: {st:.2f}%")
```

With enough trials, you’ll see switching converges to ~66.7%, staying converges to ~33.3%, confirming the **2/3 vs 1/3** analysis.

## Generalized Monty Hall (n doors, k opened)

We can extend Monty Hall:

- **n** total doors (1 car, n-1 goats)  
- Host opens **k** of the other doors (all goats, presumably).  
- Then the player can decide whether to switch to one of the remaining doors or not.

### Generalized Function

```python
def generalized_monty_hall(switch, n=3, k=1):
    """
    Simulates the Monty Hall problem with n doors and k doors opened by the host.
    Returns 1 for a win (car), 0 for a loss (goat).
    """
    if k > n - 2:
        raise ValueError("k must be <= n-2 (leaving at least one door for the final choice).")
    
    doors = np.zeros(n, dtype=int)
    prize_idx = np.random.randint(0, n)
    doors[prize_idx] = 1
    
    # Player chooses a door
    choice = np.random.randint(0, n)
    
    # Host opens k goat doors, excluding the player’s choice and the car
    open_candidates = [i for i in range(n) if i not in (prize_idx, choice)]
    opened = np.random.choice(open_candidates, size=k, replace=False)
    
    # If switching, choose among the remaining unopened doors (excluding the current choice)
    if switch:
        remaining = [i for i in range(n) if i not in opened and i != choice]
        choice = np.random.choice(remaining)
    
    return doors[choice]

def run_generalized_simulations(n, k, num_sim=10000):
    switch_wins = 0
    stay_wins = 0
    
    for _ in range(num_sim):
        switch_wins += generalized_monty_hall(True, n, k)
        stay_wins += generalized_monty_hall(False, n, k)
    
    switch_rate = switch_wins / num_sim * 100
    stay_rate = stay_wins / num_sim * 100
    return switch_rate, stay_rate
```

### Checking Results

Mathematically, staying is still $1/n$. Switching often is approximated by $\frac{n-1}{n} \times \frac{1}{(n-k-1)}$, assuming the host always knows where the car is and avoids it. Let’s see some sample runs:

```python
for n, k in [(3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (10,7)]:
    s_pct, st_pct = run_generalized_simulations(n, k, 10000)
    print(f"[n={n}, k={k}] Switch: {s_pct:.2f}%, Stay: {st_pct:.2f}%")
```

You should see results consistent with the theory: switching is generally better, especially if `k > 0`.

## Host-Ignorant Scenario

In a variation, the host does **not** know where the car is and could inadvertently open the car door. If that happens, the game ends immediately and the player loses by default.

```python
def monty_hall_host_ignorant(switch=True):
    """
    Host picks a door to open at random (not the player's choice),
    possibly revealing the car by accident, ending the game in a loss.
    """
    doors = np.array([0, 0, 0])
    prize_idx = np.random.randint(0, 3)
    doors[prize_idx] = 1
    
    choice = np.random.randint(0, 3)
    
    # Host tries to open a random door from the other two
    open_candidates = [i for i in range(3) if i != choice]
    opened = np.random.choice(open_candidates)
    
    # If the opened door is the car, game over (player loses)
    if doors[opened] == 1:
        return 0
    
    # If we survived, there's exactly one other door not opened
    if switch:
        choice = [i for i in range(3) if i not in (choice, opened)][0]
    
    return doors[choice]

def run_ignorant_sim(num_sim=10000):
    sw_win = 0
    st_win = 0
    for _ in range(num_sim):
        sw_win += monty_hall_host_ignorant(True)
        st_win += monty_hall_host_ignorant(False)
    return (sw_win / num_sim * 100, st_win / num_sim * 100)

print(run_ignorant_sim(100000))
```

In this host-ignorant scenario, the probabilities change significantly, often showing less difference between switching and staying because the host’s action is no longer guaranteed to reveal a goat. 

## Multiple Strategies (Always Switch / Always Stay / Random)

You can add a **random** strategy to see how it compares:

```python
def monty_hall_multistrategy(num_sim=10000):
    """
    Compares:
      - Always Switch
      - Always Stay
      - Random (50% chance to switch)
    """
    sw_wins, st_wins, rand_wins = 0, 0, 0
    
    for _ in range(num_sim):
        sw_wins += monty_hall(switch=True)
        st_wins += monty_hall(switch=False)
        
        # Random: 50/50 switch
        random_switch = (np.random.rand() < 0.5)
        rand_wins += monty_hall(switch=random_switch)
    
    print(f"Always Switch: {sw_wins/num_sim*100:.2f}%")
    print(f"Always Stay: {st_wins/num_sim*100:.2f}%")
    print(f"Random(50:50): {rand_wins/num_sim*100:.2f}%")

monty_hall_multistrategy(100000)
```

You’ll likely get around **66.7%** for “Always Switch,” **33.3%** for “Always Stay,” and roughly **50%** for random switching.

## Simple Heatmap for (n, k)

Plot a heatmap to visualize how the switch win rate changes with `n` and `k`. This helps show that switching is more beneficial as `n` grows, provided the host opens `k` doors:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def heatmap_monty_hall(n_max=10, k_max=8, num_sim=5000):
    # We'll store switch win rates in a 2D array
    results = np.zeros((n_max+1, k_max+1))
    
    for n in range(3, n_max+1):
        for k in range(1, min(n-1, k_max+1)):
            sw_rate, _ = run_generalized_simulations(n, k, num_sim)
            results[n, k] = sw_rate
    
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8,6))
    # origin='lower' so (n, k) starts from bottom-left in the plot
    cax = ax.imshow(
        results, origin='lower', aspect='auto',
        extent=[0, k_max+1, 0, n_max+1],
        cmap='viridis'
    )
    ax.set_title("Generalized Monty Hall: Switch Win % Heatmap")
    ax.set_xlabel("k (Doors Opened)")
    ax.set_ylabel("n (Total Doors)")
    
    cbar = fig.colorbar(cax)
    cbar.set_label('Switch Win Rate (%)')
    
    plt.show()

# heatmap_monty_hall() # In a Jupyter environment
```

You’ll see that for `n=3, k=1` we get around 66.7%, and it changes as `n` and `k` increase.

## Interactive Jupyter Notebook Demo

Below is a **Jupyter**-based interactive widget version. Run it in a Jupyter cell to play the Monty Hall game by clicking on doors:

```python
import ipywidgets as widgets
from IPython.display import display

def interactive_monty_hall():
    """
    Interactive Monty Hall in Jupyter Notebook.
    Click on doors to choose, then pick whether to switch or stay.
    """
    game = MontyHallGame()  # 3-door default
    
    door_buttons = [
        widgets.Button(description=f"Door {i+1}", layout=widgets.Layout(width='100px'))
        for i in range(3)
    ]
    switch_button = widgets.Button(description="Switch")
    stay_button = widgets.Button(description="Stay")
    
    result_label = widgets.Label(value="Choose a door to start!")
    
    def choose_door(b):
        idx = int(b.description.split()[1]) - 1
        game.choose_door(idx)
        game.host_opens_door()
        
        for i, btn in enumerate(door_buttons):
            btn.disabled = True
            if i == game.opened_door:
                btn.description = "Goat 🐐"
            elif i == idx:
                btn.description = "Chosen"
        
        result_label.value = "A goat is revealed! Switch or Stay?"
    
    def finalize_choice(b):
        if b.description == "Switch":
            game.switch_doors()
        else:
            game.stay_with_choice()
        
        won = game.get_result()
        for i, btn in enumerate(door_buttons):
            btn.disabled = True
            if game.doors[i].has_prize:
                btn.description = "Car 🚗"
            else:
                btn.description = "Goat 🐐"
        
        if won:
            result_label.value = "Congratulations! You got the car!"
        else:
            result_label.value = "Sorry, it's a goat."
    
    for btn in door_buttons:
        btn.on_click(choose_door)
    switch_button.on_click(finalize_choice)
    stay_button.on_click(finalize_choice)
    
    display(widgets.VBox([
        result_label,
        widgets.HBox(door_buttons),
        widgets.HBox([switch_button, stay_button])
    ]))

# Run interactive_monty_hall() in a Jupyter environment
```

## Command-Line (CLI) Version

For those not using Jupyter, here’s a brief console-based version. Save it in a `.py` file and run from the terminal:

```python
def monty_hall_cli():
    import random
    
    print("=== Monty Hall CLI Game ===")
    doors = [0, 0, 0]
    prize_idx = random.randint(0, 2)
    doors[prize_idx] = 1
    
    user_choice = int(input("Pick a door (0, 1, 2): "))
    
    # Host opens a goat door, chosen randomly among the doors not picked by the player
    open_candidates = [i for i in range(3) if i != user_choice and i != prize_idx]
    opened = random.choice(open_candidates)
    
    print(f"The host opens door {opened}, revealing a goat!")
    
    switch_yn = input("Do you want to switch? (y/n): ").lower()
    if switch_yn == 'y':
        user_choice = [i for i in range(3) if i not in (user_choice, opened)][0]
    
    if doors[user_choice] == 1:
        print("Congratulations! You got the car!")
    else:
        print("Sorry, you got a goat.")
```

## Wrap-Up

- Using **object-oriented** design clarifies how each door (with state) interacts with the overall game logic.  
- Simulations highlight how easily **intuitive thinking** fails for conditional probabilities.  
- By extending to a **generalized** version and the **host-ignorant** variant, we see how assumptions about the host’s knowledge drastically change the outcome.  
- This problem exemplifies how **Bayesian updates** work in real-world or AI scenarios: when new information is revealed, you should revise probabilities accordingly.

## Further Exercises

1. **Host revealing the car ends the game**: Expand the host-ignorant scenario so that if the car is revealed, the game stops immediately and see how that affects different strategies.  
2. **Multiple strategies**:  
   - Always Switch  
   - Always Stay  
   - Random p% switch  
   - Switch only if certain conditions are met (e.g., if n is large)  
3. **Larger n**: For instance, try 100 doors, open 98, see if your final intuition matches a 2/100 vs. 98/100 scenario.  
4. **Bayes’ Theorem**: Formally derive the probability step by step, then confirm that the simulation results match.  
5. **Reinforcement Learning**: (Advanced) Build a simple RL agent to learn an optimal policy for the Monty Hall game. Check if it converges to always switching.

# Extracting and Processing GDP Data
## 1. Scenario
An international bank, ***Silverman Sachs***, looking to expand its business in different countries across the world, has recruited me. I have been hired as a Data Scientist and am tasked with creating a script that can extract the list of the top 10 largest economies in the world in descending order of their GDPs in **Billion USD** (rounded to 2 decimal places), as reported by ***The International Monetary Fund (IMF)***.

The required data can be found at the following URL :

URL=https://web.archive.org/web/20230902185326/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28nominal%29


## 2. Setup
For this task, I will be using the following libraries:
* `Pandas` for managing the data.
* `Numpy` for mathematical operations.

Importing Required Libraries:
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
```

## 3. Steps
### 1) Step 1 : Extracting GDP data using ***Web Scraping***
```python
URL='https://web.archive.org/web/20230902185326/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28nominal%29'

tables=pd.read_html(URL)                     # For Extracting tables from the webpage using pandas.
df=tables[3]                                 # For Retaining table number 3 as the required dataframe.
df.columns=range(df.shape[1])                # For Replacing the column headers with column numbers
df=df[[0,2]]                                 # For Retaining columns with index 0 and 2 (name of country and value of GDP)
df=df.iloc[1:11,:]                           # For Retaining the Rows with index 1 to 10, indicationg the top 10 economies of the world.
df.columns=['Country', 'GDP (Million USD)']  # For Assigning column names as "Country" and "GDP (Million USD)"
```
The following is **table number 3** from the URL :

![GDP table from the URL](https://github.com/Atikers/Images/blob/main/Project%20%231%20-%20image%20(1).jpg)


### 2) Step 2 : Modifying the GDP Column
```python
df['GDP(Million USD)']=df['GDP(Million USD)'].astype(int)        # For Changing the data type of the 'GDP(Million USD)' column to integer. Using astype() method
df[['GDP(Million USD']]=df[['GDP(Million USD)']]/1000            # For Converting the GDP value in Million USD to Billion USD
df[['GDP(Million USD)']]=np.round(df[['GDP(Million USD)']], 2)   # For Using numpy.round() method to round the value to 2 decimal places.
df.rename(Columns={'GDP(Million USD)':'GDP(Billion USD)'})       # For Renaming the column header from 'GDP (Million USD)' to 'GDP(Billion USD)'
```
Then, I get the following :

![GDP table](https://github.com/Atikers/images/blob/main/Project%20%231%20-%20image%20(2).jpg)


### 3) Step 3 : Saving the DataFrame to CSV
```python
df.to_csv('./Largest_Economies.csv')          # For Saving the DataFrame to a CSV file named "Largest_Economies.csv"
```

## 4. Conclusion
In this project, I extracted and processed data from a web page using Python.  

I covered web scraping with `pandas.read_html()`, data manipulation with `Pandas`, and numerical operations with `Numpy`.  
This script is a basic but powerful example of how Python can be used for data science tasks.

By following these steps, I successfully created a script that extracts the list of the top 10 largest economies by GDP, processes the data, and saves it to a CSV file. This is just one of the many ways Python can be utilized in the field of data science.

With this knowledge, I can now explore more complex data extraction and processing tasks, leveraging the power of Python and its extensive libraries.

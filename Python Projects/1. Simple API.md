# Extracting and Processing GDP Data
## 1) Scenario
An international bank, ***Silverman Sachs***, looking to expand its business in different countries across the world, has recruited me. I have been hired as a Data Scientist and am tasked with creating a script that can extract the list of the top 10 largest economies in the world in descending order of their GDPs in **Billion USD** (rounded to 2 decimal places), as reported by ***The International Monetary Fund (IMF)***.

The required data can be found at the following URL :

URL=https://web.archive.org/web/20230902185326/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28nominal%29


## 2) Setup
For this task, I will be using the following libraries:
* `Pandas` for managing the data.
* `Numpy` for mathematical operations.
> **What is Library?**  
> A **library** in programming, especially in Python, is like a toolkit for a craftsman. Imagine you are building a piece of furniture. Instead of making your own hammer, saw, and nails, you use a pre-made toolkit. Similarly, a library provides pre-written code (tools) that you can use to perform common tasks, saving you the effort of writing those functions from scratch. This helps you focus on the main project (your program) without reinventing the wheel.

> **What is Pandas?**  
> **Pandas** is like a highly specialized toolkit for working with data, similar to a precision set of tools for a craftsman who works specifically with fine details and measurements. Imagine you are building a piece of furniture and you have a toolkit designed specifically for precise measuring, cutting, and assembling intricate parts. This specialized toolkit helps you manage complex tasks with ease and accuracy.
> In programming, especially in Python, Pandas is this specialized toolkit. It provides pre-written code (tools) for **data manipulation** and **analysis**, making it easy to handle, clean, transform, and analyze data efficiently. Just as a craftsman uses specialized tools to work with fine details, Pandas helps you work with detailed and structured data effortlessly, allowing you to focus on insights and analysis rather than the nitty-gritty of data handling.

> **What is NumPy?**  
> **NumPy** is like the fundamental toolkit for a craftsman working with basic materials, such as wood or metal, where precision and efficiency are crucial. Imagine you are building a piece of furniture and you have a toolkit designed specifically for cutting, shaping, and measuring raw materials accurately and efficiently. This toolkit ensures that you can perform basic operations quickly and with high precision.
> 
> In programming, especially in Python, NumPy is this fundamental toolkit. It provides pre-written code (tools) for numerical operations and handling arrays, making it easy to perform mathematical calculations, manipulate large datasets, and handle multi-dimensional data. Just as a craftsman relies on essential tools to shape raw materials, NumPy gives you the basic building blocks to perform numerical computations efficiently, allowing you to build more complex structures (programs) with a solid foundation.

Importing Required Libraries:
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
```


## 3) Steps
### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Step 1 : Extracting GDP data using ***Web Scraping***
```python
URL='https://web.archive.org/web/20230902185326/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28nominal%29'

tables=pd.read_html(URL)                     # For Extracting tables from the webpage using pandas.
df=tables[3]                                 # For Retaining table number 3 as the required dataframe.
df.columns=range(df.shape[1])                # For Replacing the column headers with column numbers
df=df[[0,2]]                                 # For Retaining columns with index 0 and 2 (name of country and value of GDP)
df=df.iloc[1:11,:]                           # For Retaining the Rows with index 1 to 10, indicationg the top 10 economies of the world.
df.columns=['Country', 'GDP (Million USD)']  # For Assigning column names as "Country" and "GDP (Million USD)"
```
The following is **table number 3** from the URL :

![GDP table from the URL](https://github.com/Atikers/Images/blob/main/Project%20%231%20-%20image%20(1).jpg)


### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Step 2 : Modifying the GDP Column
```python
df['GDP(Million USD)']=df['GDP(Million USD)'].astype(int)        # For Changing the data type of the 'GDP(Million USD)' column to integer. Using astype() method
df[['GDP(Million USD']]=df[['GDP(Million USD)']]/1000            # For Converting the GDP value in Million USD to Billion USD
df[['GDP(Million USD)']]=np.round(df[['GDP(Million USD)']], 2)   # For Using numpy.round() method to round the value to 2 decimal places.
df.rename(Columns={'GDP(Million USD)':'GDP(Billion USD)'})       # For Renaming the column header from 'GDP (Million USD)' to 'GDP(Billion USD)'
```
Then, I get the following :

![GDP table](https://github.com/Atikers/images/blob/main/Project%20%231%20-%20image%20(2).jpg)


### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Step 3 : Saving the DataFrame to CSV
```python
df.to_csv('./Largest_Economies.csv')          # For Saving the DataFrame to a CSV file named "Largest_Economies.csv"
```

## 4) Conclusion
In this project, I extracted and processed data from a web page using Python.  

I covered web scraping with `pandas.read_html()`, data manipulation with `Pandas`, and numerical operations with `Numpy`.  
This script is a basic but powerful example of how Python can be used for data science tasks.

By following these steps, I successfully created a script that extracts the list of the top 10 largest economies by GDP, processes the data, and saves it to a CSV file. This is just one of the many ways Python can be utilized in the field of data science.

With this knowledge, I can now explore more complex data extraction and processing tasks, leveraging the power of Python and its extensive libraries.

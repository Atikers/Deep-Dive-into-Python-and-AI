# Analyzing real world data-set with SQL and Python

## 1) Scenario

The city of Chicago released a dataset of all school level performance data used to create School Report Cards for the 2011-212 school year. The dataset is available from the Chicago Data Portal: https://data.cityofchicago.org/Education/Chicago-Public-Schools-Progress-Report-Cards-2011-/9xs2-f89t

And The council of Chicago is interested in analyzing data to help them understand school performance and identify areas for improvement. So, They have asked me to help them analyze the data and present my findings.

This dataset includes a large number of metrics. To start, I need to familiarize myself with the types of metrics in the database:  
https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/assets/AAD41A13-BE8A-4E67-B1F5-86E711E09D5F?download=true

## 2) Steps

### Step 1 : Connect to the database

```python
import csv, sqlite3 #importing the required libraries

con=sqlite3.connect("RealWorldData.db") #connecting to the database
cur = con.cursor()  #creating a cursor object : cursor is used to traverse the records from the result set
```
```python
!pip install -q pandas   # installing pandas library : "!pip" is used to run the command in the jupyter notebook. "-q" is used to hide the output
```
```python
%load_ext sql  #loading the sql extension
```
```python
%sql sqlite:///RealWorldData.db  #connecting to the database
```

### Step 2 : Store the dataset in a table

To anlayze the data using SQL, I need to store the dataset in a table. Because, In most cases, the dataset is available as a CSV file. So, I will use the `pandas` library to read the dataset and store it in a table.

```python
import pandas as pd  #importing the pandas library
```
```python
df=pandas.read_csv("https://github.com/Atikers/Dataset-Files/blob/main/Ch%204/1.%20ChicagoPublicSchools.csv")  # Load the data from the URL into pandas dafaframe
```
```python
df.to_sql('CHICAGO_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS_DATA', con, if_exists='replace', index=False, method='multi')  #store the dataset in a table
```

### Step 3 : Query the database system catalog to retrieve table metadata

```sql
%sql SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table';  #querying the database to retrieve the table names
```

Then, I get the following :    
![image](https://github.com/Atikers/Images/blob/main/Ch%204.%20SQL%20Projects/project%20%23%201/image.png)

```sql

### Step 4 : Query the database system catalog to retrieve column metadata

Now, I will query the database to retrive column metadata. This procedure is needed to understand the structure of the table!

```sql
%sql SELECT count(name) FROM PRAGMA_TABLE_INFO('CHICAGO_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS_DATA');  #retreiving the number of columns in the table
```

Then, I get the following :    
![image](https://github.com/Atikers/Images/blob/main/Ch%204.%20SQL%20Projects/project%20%23%201/image-1.png)

```sql
%sql SELECT name,type,length(type) FROM PRAGMA_TABLE_INFO('CHICAGO_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS_DATA');
```

Then, I get the following :    
![image](https://github.com/Atikers/Images/blob/main/Ch%204.%20SQL%20Projects/project%20%23%201/image-2.png)
![image](https://github.com/Atikers/Images/blob/main/Ch%204.%20SQL%20Projects/project%20%23%201/image-3.png)
![image](https://github.com/Atikers/Images/blob/main/Ch%204.%20SQL%20Projects/project%20%23%201/image-4.png)

### Step 5 : Analyzing the data

Now, I will analyze the data to help the council of Chicago to understand school performance and identify areas for improvement.

#### How many Elementary Schools are in the dataset?

```sql
%sql SELECT COUNT(*) FROM CHICAGO_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS_DATA WHERE "Elementary, Middle, or High School" = 'ES';
```

Then, I get the following :    
![image](https://github.com/Atikers/Images/blob/main/Ch%204.%20SQL%20Projects/project%20%23%201/image-5.png)

#### What is the highest Safety Score?

```sql
%sql SELECT MAX(Safety_Score) FROM CHICAGO_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS_DATA;
```

Then, I get the following :    
![image](https://github.com/Atikers/Images/blob/main/Ch%204.%20SQL%20Projects/project%20%23%201/image-6.png)

#### Which schools have highest Safety Score?

```sql
%sql SELECT Name_of_School, Safety_Score FROM CHICAGO_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS_DATA WHERE Safety_Score = (SELECT MAX(Safety_Score) FROM CHICAGO_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS_DATA); # using subquery
```
> **Why use a subquery?**    
> Because, subquery is used to return data that will be used in the main query as a condition to further restrict the data to be retrieved.

Then, I get the following :    
![image](https://github.com/Atikers/Images/blob/main/Ch%204.%20SQL%20Projects/project%20%23%201/image-7.png)

#### What are the top 10 schools with the highest "Average Student Attendance"?

```sql
%sql SELECT Name_of_School, Average_Student_Attendance FROM CHICAGO_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS_DATA ORDER BY Average_Student_Attendance DESC LIMIT 10; #ordering the data in descending order and limiting the result to 10
```

Then, I get the following :    
![image](https://github.com/Atikers/Images/blob/main/Ch%204.%20SQL%20Projects/project%20%23%201/image-8.png)

#### Retrieve the list of 5 Schools with the lowest Average Student Attendance sorted in ascending order based on attendance

```sql
%sql SELECT Name_of_School, Average_Student_Attendance FROM CHICAGO_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS_DATA ORDER BY Average_Student_Attendance LIMIT 5; #ordering the data in ascending order and limiting the result to 5
```

Then, I get the following :    
![image](https://github.com/Atikers/Images/blob/main/Ch%204.%20SQL%20Projects/project%20%23%201/image-9.png)

#### Now, I will remove the '%' sign from the above result set for Average Student Attendance column

```sql
%sql SELECT Name_of_School, REPLACE(Average_Student_Attendance, '%', '') FROM CHICAGO_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS_DATA ORDER BY Average_Student_Attendance LIMIT 5; #replacing the '%' sign with empty string
```

Then, I get the following :    
![image](https://github.com/Atikers/Images/blob/main/Ch%204.%20SQL%20Projects/project%20%23%201/image-10.png)

#### Which Schools have Average Student Attendance lower than 70%?

```python
%sql SELECT Name_of_School, Average_Student_Attendance FROM CHICAGO_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS_DATA WHERE CAST(REPLACE(Average_Student_Attendance, '%', '') AS DOUBLE) < 70; #casting the column to float and comparing
```

Then, I get the following :    
![image](https://github.com/Atikers/Images/blob/main/Ch%204.%20SQL%20Projects/project%20%23%201/image-11.png)

#### Get the 5 College Enrollment for each Community Area

```sql
%sql SELECT Community_Area_Name, SUM(College_Enrollment) AS Total_Enrollment FROM CHICAGO_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS_DATA GROUP BY Community_Area_Name order by Total_Enrollment asc LIMIT 5; #grouping the data by Community Area Name
```

Then, I get the following :    
![image](https://github.com/Atikers/Images/blob/main/Ch%204.%20SQL%20Projects/project%20%23%201/image-12.png)

## 3) Conclusion

I have successfully analyzed the data and presented my findings to the council of Chicago. The council of Chicago can use these findings to understand school performance and identify areas for improvement. What a great experience!

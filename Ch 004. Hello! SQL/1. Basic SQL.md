# Basic SQL

## 1. Introduction to **SQL**, **Database** and **DBMS**

### 1) What is SQL?

You've probably heard about **SQL(Structured Query Languge)**. What is it? and why do we learn it? why is **SQL** important for understanding **AI**?    

**SQL** is a language. Just as **Python** is a language, **SQL** is also a language. In the real world, being bilingual(or multilingual) is an advantage, and the same applies to programming languages.

SQL is used for working with relational databases and querying data. It allows you to communicate with a **database**. SQL acts like a **key to access the database**, enabling you to manipulate the data within it. This is why **SQL** is important for understanding **AI**.    

**AI** is all about data. Data is the fuel for AI. AI algorithms need data to learn and make decisions. Data is stored in databases. SQL is used to access and manipulate this data. So, if you want to work with AI, you need to know SQL.    

### 2) What is Data?

**Data** is a collection of facts, figures, or pieces of information that can be processed, analyzed, and used to derive insights or make decisions. These facts can take various forms such as numbers, text, images, sounds, or other observations. Data represents the raw material from which knowledge is derived, making it one of the most critical assets in today's digital world.

#### Types of Data
Data can be classified into several types:

1. **Structured Data:** 
   - Organized data that follows a specific format.
   - Typically stored in databases with rows and columns.
   - Examples: tables in a relational database, spreadsheets, CSV(Comma Separated Value) files.

2. **Unstructured Data:** 
   - Data that doesn't follow a predefined structure.
   - Harder to store and analyze.
   - Examples: text files, emails, social media posts, images, videos, audio files.

3. **Semi-Structured Data:** 
   - Data that doesn't fit neatly into a relational database but has some organizational properties.
   - Examples: XML files, JSON files.

#### The Importance of Data
Data is often referred to as the "new gold" or "new oil" due to its immense value in the modern world. Organizations collect, analyze, and utilize data for various purposes: Make Informed Decisions, Solve Problems, Drive Innovation, Enhance Efficiency, Personalization

#### Data as an Asset
In today's data-driven world, data is considered a strategic asset:

- Companies invest in data analytics, data science, and big data technologies to extract value from their data.
- Fields like data engineering, data science, and data analytics focus on different aspects of collecting, processing, analyzing, and interpreting data.

### 3) What is Database?

A **database** is a structured repository of data, designed to store, manage, and retrieve information efficiently. It is a collection of related data organized in a way that supports easy access, management, and updating of that data. Databases are essential in various applications, from simple websites to complex enterprise systems, providing the backbone for data storage and manipulation.

#### Types of Databases
There are various types of databases, each designed to meet different needs and use cases:

1. Relational Databases

    - A relational database is like a **file cabinet with multiple drawers**, where each drawer contains files that are related to each other, and connections between drawers (tables) allow for organized and interconnected storage.
    - Data is stored in tables, which consist of rows and columns. 
    - Each table represents a collection of related items (e.g., customers, products), and each column represents a property of those items (e.g., last name, first name, address).
    - Tables in a relational database can be linked or related to each other, allowing for complex queries and data retrieval across multiple tables.
    - **Examples:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database.

2. NoSQL Databases
   
    - Unlike relational databases, NoSQL databases do not use a tabular structure.
    - They might store data in formats such as documents (JSON), key-value pairs, wide columns, or graphs.
    - **Flexibility:** NoSQL databases are often more flexible and scalable than relational databases, making them suitable for handling large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data.
    - **Examples:** MongoDB (document-based), Cassandra (wide-column store), Redis (key-value store).

3. Other Types of Databases
- **Graph Databases:** Focused on storing and querying relationships between data, using graph structures with nodes, edges, and properties. e.g. Neo4j.
- **Time-Series Databases:** Optimized for time-stamped or time-series data, often used in monitoring and IoT applications. e.g. InfluxDB.
- **Object-Oriented Databases:** Store data as objects, similar to how data is handled in object-oriented programming languages. e.g. db4o.

### 4) Why Databases are Important
Imagine a library where every book is randomly placed on the shelves without any order or catalog system. Finding a book, ensuring it’s not misplaced, or making sure two people can read it without damaging it would be nearly impossible. This chaotic scenario is what a data-driven environment would look like without databases.

Databases play a critical role in modern computing environments by:

- **Ensuring Data Integrity:** They enforce rules that maintain the accuracy and consistency of data.
- **Supporting Concurrent Access:** : Multiple users can access and manipulate the data simultaneously without conflicts.
- **Providing Security:** Databases offer various security mechanisms to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.
- **Facilitating Data Analytics:** They enable complex queries that can be used for data analysis, reporting, and decision-making.

### 5) What is DBMS?

Imagine you have a large file cabinet filled with important documents, and you need someone to manage this cabinet for you. This person would be responsible for organizing the documents, ensuring they are stored correctly, making sure that only authorized people can access them, and retrieving them quickly when needed. This person is like a **Database Management System (DBMS)**.

#### What is RDBMS?

Now, if your file cabinet has multiple drawers, each containing different types of documents that are related to each other, you’d need a system to manage these relationships and ensure that you can quickly find and correlate information across drawers. This is where **Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)** come in:

- **RDBMS is like the person who manages the file cabinet with multiple drawers.**
  - Each drawer represents a table in the database, and the relationships between the drawers (or tables) are maintained and managed by the RDBMS.
  - RDBMS controls the data's organization, access, storage, and retrieval in a relational format, where data is stored in tables and relationships between different tables are maintained. This makes it easier to query and analyze data.

- **Examples:** Examples of RDBMS include MySQL, Oracle Database, IBM DB2, and Microsoft SQL Server, each of which provides a robust environment for managing large volumes of relational data efficiently.



## 2. Basic SQL commands : `Create`, `Insert`, `Select`, `Update`, `Delete`, etc.
These commands are used to perform operations on the database.    
I will explain these commands at the next page.

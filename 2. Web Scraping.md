# Data Analysis
## 1) Scenario
I will learn how to approach data acquisition in various ways and obtain necessary insights from a dataset.
I will successfully load the data into Jupyter Notebook and gain some fundamental insights via the Pandas Library.

In this case, **the Diabetes Dataset** is an online source and it is in CSV format.

> **About this Dataset**    
**Context** : This dataset is originally from ***the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases***. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years of age of Pima Indian heritage.    
**Content** : The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.

## 2) Setup
```python
Import pandas as pd      # Import pandas library
```
```python
filename = "https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-PY0101EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Module%205/data/diabetes.csv"

async def download(url, filename):
    response = await pyfetch(url)
    if response.status == 200:
        with open(filename, "wb") as f:
            f.write(await response.bytes())

await download(filename, "diabetes.csv")
df = pd.read_csv("diabetes.csv")
```
After reading the dataset, I can use the `dataframe.head(n)` method to check the top n rows of the dataframe, where n is an integer.    
Contrary to `dataframe.head(n)`, `dataframe.tail(n)` will show me the bottom n rows of the dataframe.
```python
print("The first 5 rows of the dataframe")         # show the first 5 rows using dataframe.head() method
df.head(5)
```
Then, I get the table below :

## 3) Steps
### (1) Step 1 : Statistical Overview of dataset
```python
df.info()        # This method prints information about a DataFrame including the index dtype and columns, non-null values and memory usage.
df.describe()    # This method is used to view some basic statistical details like percentile, mean, standard deviation, etc. of a data frame or a series of numeric values.
```


tables=pd.read_html(URL)                     # Extracting tables from the webpage using pandas.
df=tables[3]                                 # Retaining table number 3 as the required dataframe.
df.columns=range(df.shape[1])                # Replacing the column headers with column numbers
df=df[[0,2]]                                 # Retaining columns with index 0 and 2 (name of country and value of GDP)
df=df.iloc[1:11,:]                           # Retaining the Rows with index 1 to 10, indicationg the top 10 economies of the world.
df.columns=['Country', 'GDP (Million USD)']  # Assigning column names as "Country" and "GDP (Million USD)"
```
The following is **table number 3** from the URL :

![GDP table from the URL](https://github.com/Atikers/Images/blob/main/Project%20%231%20-%20image%20(1).jpg)


### (2) Step 2 : Modifying the GDP Column
```python
df['GDP(Million USD)']=df['GDP(Million USD)'].astype(int)        # Changing the data type of the 'GDP(Million USD)' column to integer. Using astype() method
df[['GDP(Million USD']]=df[['GDP(Million USD)']]/1000            # Converting the GDP value in Million USD to Billion USD
df[['GDP(Million USD)']]=np.round(df[['GDP(Million USD)']], 2)   # Using numpy.round() method to round the value to 2 decimal places.
df.rename(Columns={'GDP(Million USD)':'GDP(Billion USD)'})       # Renaming the column header from 'GDP (Million USD)' to 'GDP(Billion USD)'
```
The table I get is shown below :

![GDP table](https://github.com/Atikers/images/blob/main/Project%20%231%20-%20image%20(2).jpg)


### (3) Step 3 : Saving the DataFrame to CSV
```python
df.to_csv('./Largest_Economies.csv')          # Saving the DataFrame to a CSV file named "Largest_Economies.csv"

# Introduction to Relational Databases and Tables

## 1. Relational Database Concepts

Relational databases are the most widely used data model in the world. This is due to their simplicity and powerful capabilities in managing data.

### Data Independence

One of the key advantages of the relational model is **data independence**. This means that data is stored independently of the applications that use it, allowing the data to be optimized for storage and retrieval without being tied to any particular application's structure.

- **Logical Data Independence**: The ability to change the logical schema without affecting the application.
- **Physical Data Independence**: The ability to change the physical schema without affecting the application.
- **Physical Storage Independence**: The ability to change the physical storage method without affecting the application.

### 1) Entity-Relationship Model

The Entity-Relationship (ER) model is a tool used to design relational databases.

- **Entities**: Objects or concepts about which data is stored.
- **Attributes**: Characteristics or properties of entities.

> **Example**: Consider a **Book** entity with attributes such as **title**, **author**, **year**, **isbn**, **publisher**, **pages**, and **price**.

### 2) Mapping Entity Diagrams to Tables

In relational databases, entities become tables, and attributes become columns.

- **Example**: The **Book** entity can be represented as a table named **Book** with columns such as **title**, **author**, **year**, **isbn**, **publisher**, **pages**, and **price**.

> **Data Types**:
> - **char**: A fixed-length character data type. For example, `char(2)` stores a string with a fixed length of 2 characters.
> - **varchar**: A variable-length character data type. For example, `varchar(24)` stores a string with a maximum length of 24 characters.

### 3) Primary Keys and Foreign Keys

- **Primary Key**: A column that uniquely identifies each row in a table.
  > **Analogy**: The primary key is like a social security number, where each person has a unique identifier. For example, in an **Author** table, the `Author_id` column might be the primary key, uniquely identifying each author.

- **Foreign Key**: A column that is a primary key in another table, used to link tables together.
  > **Analogy**: In a **Book** table, the `Author_id` might be a foreign key linking to the `Author_id` in the **Author** table, establishing a relationship between books and their authors.

## 2. Types of SQL Statements (DDL vs. DML)

SQL statements are categorized into two main types: Data Definition Language (DDL) and Data Manipulation Language (DML).

### 1) DDL (Data Definition Language)

Used to **define, change, or drop** the structure of data. It's akin to building the structure of a house.

- **`CREATE TABLE`**: Creates a new table.
- **`ALTER TABLE`**: Modifies an existing table.
- **`DROP TABLE`**: Deletes a table.
- **`TRUNCATE TABLE`**: Deletes all rows from a table.

### 2) DML (Data Manipulation Language)

Used to **retrieve, insert, update, or delete** data. This is like moving furniture into the house.

- **`SELECT`**: Retrieves data from a table.
- **`INSERT INTO`**: Inserts new rows into a table.
- **`UPDATE`**: Updates existing rows in a table.
- **`DELETE`**: Deletes rows from a table.

## 3. `CREATE TABLE` Statement

The `CREATE TABLE` statement is used to create a new table in a database. It specifies the table's name and defines its columns and their data types.

- **Syntax**:
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE table_name (
        column1_name data_type,
        column2_name data_type,
        ...
        columnN_name data_type
    );
    ```

- **Example**: Create a table for Canadian provinces:
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE provinces (
        id char(2) PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
        name varchar(24)
    );
    ```

This command would create a table as shown below:

> **Constraints**:
> - **Not Null**: Ensures that a column cannot contain null values. If you attempt to insert a null value, it will result in an error.

- **Example**: Create a table for books:
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE books (
        author_id CHAR(2) PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
        lastname VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL,
        firstname VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL,
        email VARCHAR(40),
        city VARCHAR(15),
        country CHAR(2)
    );
    ```

> **Primary Key**: `author_id` - Uniquely identifies each row in the table.  
> **Not Null**: `lastname`, `firstname` - Ensures these columns cannot contain null values.

## 4. `ALTER`, `DROP`, `TRUNCATE TABLE` Statements

### 1) `ALTER TABLE` Statement

The `ALTER TABLE` statement is used to add or remove columns, modify the data type of columns, or add/remove constraints on an existing table.

- **Syntax**:
    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE table_name
    ADD column_name data_type;
    DROP column_name;
    MODIFY column_name data_type;
    ```

- **Example**:
    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE books
    ADD birthdate DATE;   # Adds a new column 'birthdate' with data type 'DATE'
    DROP email;           # Deletes the 'email' column
    MODIFY city VARCHAR(20);  # Changes the data type of the 'city' column to 'VARCHAR(20)'
    ```

### 2) `TRUNCATE TABLE` Statement

The `TRUNCATE TABLE` statement deletes all data in a table without deleting the table itself.

- **Syntax**:
    ```sql
    TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;
    ```

- **Example**:
    ```sql
    TRUNCATE TABLE books;   # Deletes all rows from the 'books' table
    ```
